    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.CollectionStrategy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 41 lines of code (loc=41), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=8) is also low, suggesting low implementation complexity. With only 2 nested classes (nc=2) and no fields (nof=0), the class does not exhibit the characteristics of insufficient modularization that would require further decomposition."
