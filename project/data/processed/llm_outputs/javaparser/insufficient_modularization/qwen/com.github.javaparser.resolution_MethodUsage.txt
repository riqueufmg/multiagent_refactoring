    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.MethodUsage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC=38 and NOM=24 methods, indicating it may be doing too much. It has 5 fields and 175 lines of code, suggesting significant implementation complexity. The class directly depends on 5 other types, showing it has multiple responsibilities. With DIT=1, it's not part of a deep inheritance hierarchy, so the complexity is inherent to this single class rather than inherited. The combination of high method count, high weighted method complexity, and multiple dependencies suggests insufficient modularization - this class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
