    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with WMC=23 and NOM=16, but these metrics alone do not indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a well-contained statement node in an AST with appropriate responsibilities for handling while statements. No clear evidence of internal decomposition opportunities based on the provided metrics and dependencies."
