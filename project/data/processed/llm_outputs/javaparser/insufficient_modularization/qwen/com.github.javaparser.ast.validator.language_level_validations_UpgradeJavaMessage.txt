    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 3 fields (nof=3) with low complexity (wmc=3, loc=34). The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure indicates it is already well modularized. No evidence of insufficient modularization as the class appears to have appropriate size and complexity for its functionality."
