    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.AbstractJavaParserContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=15), a high weighted method count (wmc=49), and a large number of dependencies (20 external dependencies). The lines of code (loc=187) and number of classes (nc=27) also indicate substantial complexity. These metrics suggest that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
