{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.VariableDeclarator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC=45 (high cyclomatic complexity), NOM=23 (many methods), NOF=3 (fields present), and depends on 17 external classes which suggests it handles multiple responsibilities. The high method count (23 total, 22 public) and substantial LOC=169 indicate the class likely contains too much functionality that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
