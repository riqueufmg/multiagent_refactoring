    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 41 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 33 suggesting the class has too many responsibilities, and LOC (Lines of Code) is 230 indicating a large class size. The high method count and complexity suggest this class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
