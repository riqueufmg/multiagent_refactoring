    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java25Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1) and 10 lines of code (loc=10), which indicates minimal complexity and size. The Weighted Method Count (wmc=1) is also very low, suggesting simple implementation complexity. There are no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating a simple, focused class that does not require further decomposition."
