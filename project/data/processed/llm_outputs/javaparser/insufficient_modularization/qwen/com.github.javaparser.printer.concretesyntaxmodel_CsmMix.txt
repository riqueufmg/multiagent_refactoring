    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=10, LOC=33, NOM=6) and no inheritance (DIT=1) or composition (fanin=0, fanout=0) relationships that would suggest insufficient modularization. The low number of methods and lines of code indicate proper decomposition."
