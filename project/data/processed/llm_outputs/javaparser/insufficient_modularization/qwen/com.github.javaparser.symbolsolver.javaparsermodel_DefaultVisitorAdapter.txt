    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.DefaultVisitorAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (103), all of which are public, indicating a lack of internal modularization. The high WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) value of 103 further supports the complexity. The class likely handles too many responsibilities without being decomposed into smaller, more manageable modules, which is a sign of Insufficient Modularization."
