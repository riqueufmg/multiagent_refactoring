    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.TypePatternExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), minimal fields (nof=2), and low lines of code (loc=10). The lack of inheritance complexity (dit=5 but this is reasonable for metamodel classes) and absence of coupling issues (fanin=0, fanout=0, lcom=0.0) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple data structure or value object within the metamodel framework."
