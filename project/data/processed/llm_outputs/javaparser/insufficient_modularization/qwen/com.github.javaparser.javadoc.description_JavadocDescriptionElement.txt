    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 6 lines of code (loc=6), and a weighted method count of 1 (wmc=1). The low number of fields (nof=0) and methods indicates it is already well-decomposed. The class appears to be a simple data element rather than a complex class that needs further decomposition."
