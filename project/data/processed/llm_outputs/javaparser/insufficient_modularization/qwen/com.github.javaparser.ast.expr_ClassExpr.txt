    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.ClassExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14, nopm=14) and 69 lines of code (loc=69), which represents a moderate size. The weighted method count (wmc=18) indicates reasonable complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and good cohesion (lcom=0.71), the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The metrics suggest appropriate modularization for its functionality."
