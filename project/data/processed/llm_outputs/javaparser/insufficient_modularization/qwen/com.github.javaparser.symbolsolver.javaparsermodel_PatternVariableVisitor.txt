    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.PatternVariableVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) with 5 public methods (nopm=5), WMC of 16 indicating moderate complexity, and LOC of 84. While the class has some complexity, the metric values do not indicate severe insufficiency in modularization. The class appears to have a reasonable size and complexity for its functionality as a visitor pattern implementation dealing with pattern variables and AST node traversal."
