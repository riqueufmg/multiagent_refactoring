```json
{
    "class": "main.Parent.MyEnum",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 1 line of code (loc=1). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). This indicates a very simple enum class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it lacks the complexity that would require further decomposition."
