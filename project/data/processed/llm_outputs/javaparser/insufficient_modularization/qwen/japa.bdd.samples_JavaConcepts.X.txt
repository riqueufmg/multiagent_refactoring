    "class": "japa.bdd.samples.JavaConcepts.X",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), 7 lines of code (loc=7), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The low size and complexity indicate that further decomposition is not necessary as the class is already sufficiently simple and modular."
