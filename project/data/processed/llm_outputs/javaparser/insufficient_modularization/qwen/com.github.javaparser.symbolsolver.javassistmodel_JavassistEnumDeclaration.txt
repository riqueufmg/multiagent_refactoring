{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistEnumDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 28 methods (nom=28) with 40 weighted method count (wmc=40), indicating high implementation complexity. It also has a large size with 136 lines of code (loc=136). The class directly depends on 11 external classes, suggesting it has multiple responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce complexity and improve modularity."
