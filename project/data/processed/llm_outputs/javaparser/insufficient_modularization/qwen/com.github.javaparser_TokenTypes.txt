{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.TokenTypes",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 10 methods (nom=10, nopm=10) and 66 lines of code (loc=66), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=166) is high relative to the number of methods, but this is likely due to the nature of token type definitions which may involve complex switch statements or similar constructs. With no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no class dependencies (nc=0, dit=0), this appears to be a simple utility or constants class that is already well-decomposed for its purpose."
