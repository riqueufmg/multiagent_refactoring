    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 9 lines of code (loc=9), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=3) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With no fields (nof=0) and no dependencies, this class is already sufficiently modularized for its simple purpose."
