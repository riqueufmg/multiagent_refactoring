    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=39, nopm=36) and a high Weighted Methods per Class value (wmc=57), indicating high complexity. The Lines of Code (loc=197) also suggest a substantial implementation size. With a low LCOM value (0.1538461538461538), it indicates high cohesion, but the sheer size and method count suggest that further decomposition could reduce complexity and improve maintainability, which aligns with the characteristics of Insufficient Modularization."
