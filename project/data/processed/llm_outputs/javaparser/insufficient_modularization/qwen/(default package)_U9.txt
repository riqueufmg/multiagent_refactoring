    "class": "(default package).U9",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3) and 8 lines of code (loc=8), which indicates a very small and simple class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=3) also shows low complexity. There are no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies, suggesting minimal functionality that would benefit from further decomposition."
