    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.HashCodeVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=105, nopm=104) and a high Weighted Methods per Class (wmc=106), indicating high complexity. It also has a large number of dependencies (97 external classes), suggesting it handles too many responsibilities and could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
