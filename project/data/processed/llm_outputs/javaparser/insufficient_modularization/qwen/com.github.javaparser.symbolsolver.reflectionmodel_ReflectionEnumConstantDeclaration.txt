    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionEnumConstantDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 4 weighted method count (wmc=4), and 19 lines of code (loc=19). The lack of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low coupling (lcom=0.0) indicate proper modularization. The small size and low complexity metrics do not suggest insufficient modularization."
