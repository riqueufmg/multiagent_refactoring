```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.serialization.JavaParserJsonSerializer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 6 methods with a total of 129 lines of code and a Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) of 14, indicating high implementation complexity. It also contains 4 fields and defines 3 inner classes (JsonNode, JsonToken, JsonTokenRange, JsonRange), contributing to its large size and complexity. The class appears to be handling multiple responsibilities including serialization logic, JSON node representation, and range/token management, suggesting it could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
