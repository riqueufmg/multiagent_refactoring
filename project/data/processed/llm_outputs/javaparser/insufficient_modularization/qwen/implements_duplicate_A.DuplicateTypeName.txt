```json
{
    "class": "implements_duplicate.A.DuplicateTypeName",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 2 lines of code (loc=2). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 0 (wmc=0) and fan-in/fan-out are both 0, indicating no internal complexity or external dependencies. While the DIT value of 3096 appears unusually high, this alone does not indicate insufficient modularization since the class itself has minimal internal complexity and would not benefit from further decomposition."
