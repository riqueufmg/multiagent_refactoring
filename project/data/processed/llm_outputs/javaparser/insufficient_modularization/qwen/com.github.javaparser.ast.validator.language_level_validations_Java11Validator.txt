    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java11Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=1, LOC=13), single method (NOM=1), and is already well-decomposed. The high DIT (14) indicates it's part of a deep inheritance hierarchy but does not suggest insufficient modularization. LCOM=0.0 indicates good cohesion, and the minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest proper encapsulation. The class appears to be appropriately sized and decomposed for its purpose."
