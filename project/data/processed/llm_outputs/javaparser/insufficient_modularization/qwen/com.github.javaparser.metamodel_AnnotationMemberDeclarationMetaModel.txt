    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.AnnotationMemberDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), minimal lines of code (loc=12), no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), and is already well-decomposed with only 4 fields and 4 property fields. The low WMC and LCOM values indicate good cohesion and simplicity, suggesting sufficient modularization has been achieved."
