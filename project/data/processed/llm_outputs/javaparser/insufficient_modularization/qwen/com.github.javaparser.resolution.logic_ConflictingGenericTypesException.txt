    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic.ConflictingGenericTypesException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 0 fields (nof=0), and 8 lines of code (loc=8). It appears to be a simple exception class with no business logic that requires further decomposition. The low metric values indicate proper modularization rather than insufficient modularization."
