    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.VisitorList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 37 methods (nom=37, nopm=37) and 175 lines of code (loc=175), indicating high size and complexity. The weighted method count (wmc=48) further confirms high implementation complexity. With 6 fields (nof=6) and no package dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this suggests a class that could benefit from decomposition to reduce its size and complexity."
