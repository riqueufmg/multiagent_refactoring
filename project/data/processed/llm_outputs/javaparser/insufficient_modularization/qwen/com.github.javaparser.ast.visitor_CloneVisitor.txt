{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.CloneVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom: 107, nopm: 103), high lines of code (loc: 1082), and a high weighted method count (wmc: 115). These metrics indicate high complexity and size, suggesting insufficient modularization as the class could potentially be decomposed into smaller, more manageable classes."
