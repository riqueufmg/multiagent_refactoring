    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) with 8 being public (nopm=8), indicating a focused and well-defined interface. The lines of code (loc=71) and weighted method count (wmc=11) are relatively low, suggesting manageable complexity. The lack of fields (nof=1, nopf=0) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.222) indicate proper encapsulation and method cohesion. The absence of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests simplicity in external interactions. These metrics indicate sufficient modularization with appropriate size and complexity for its functionality."
