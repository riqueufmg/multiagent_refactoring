    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionEnumDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 23 methods (nom=23, nopm=23) and a weighted method count of 40 (wmc=40), indicating high implementation complexity. With only 3 fields (nof=3) and 149 lines of code (loc=149), the class implements substantial functionality that could potentially be decomposed into smaller, more manageable units. The lack of any class hierarchy depth (dit=5 but nc=0 indicates no subclasses) and zero fan-in/fan-out dependencies suggest this class may be doing too much internally rather than delegating responsibilities appropriately, pointing to insufficient modularization."
