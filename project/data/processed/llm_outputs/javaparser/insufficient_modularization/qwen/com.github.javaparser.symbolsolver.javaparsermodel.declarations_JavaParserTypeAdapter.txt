    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserTypeAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 41 which is very high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 135 indicating substantial size, NOM (Number of Methods) is 12 which contributes to complexity, and it depends on 10 external classes suggesting high coupling. These metrics collectively indicate the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
