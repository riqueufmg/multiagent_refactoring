    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistMethodDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 20 methods (nom=20) and 70 lines of code (loc=70), which represents a moderate size. The Weighted Methods per Class metric (wmc=20) aligns with the number of methods, indicating straightforward method complexity. The Lack of Cohesion metric (lcom=0.25) suggests reasonable cohesion. With only 3 fields (nof=3) and no package-level dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), the class does not exhibit signs of excessive complexity or insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
