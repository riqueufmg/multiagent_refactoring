{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.ArrayType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 26 methods (nom=26) with 25 being public (nopm=25), high WMC of 38 indicating high complexity, and 196 lines of code (loc=196). It also has a high number of dependencies (17 external classes) and 5 levels of inheritance (dit=5). These metrics indicate the class is doing too much and could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
