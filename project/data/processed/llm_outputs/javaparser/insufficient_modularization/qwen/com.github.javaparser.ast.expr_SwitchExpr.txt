    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.SwitchExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC=29 (high cyclomatic complexity), NOM=18 (many methods), LOC=110 (large size), and LCOM=0.556 (moderate lack of cohesion). With 18 methods and 29 weighted method complexity, the class implements substantial functionality that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more cohesive components. The high method count and complexity suggest the class has not been completely decomposed."
