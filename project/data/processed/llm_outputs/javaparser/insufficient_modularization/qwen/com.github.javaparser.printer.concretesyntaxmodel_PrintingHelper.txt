    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1) and 16 lines of code (loc=16), with a low weighted method count (wmc=4). The class is already highly cohesive with no fields (nof=0) and no complexity indicators suggesting insufficient modularization. The minimal size and low complexity do not indicate a need for further decomposition."
