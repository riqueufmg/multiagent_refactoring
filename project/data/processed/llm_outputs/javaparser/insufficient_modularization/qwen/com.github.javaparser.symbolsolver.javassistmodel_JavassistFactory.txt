{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 2 public methods (nopm=2), and 58 lines of code (loc=58). The weighted method count (wmc=16) indicates moderate complexity but is not excessive for a class of this size. With only 0 fields (nof=0), the class appears to be a lightweight factory class with focused responsibilities. The low number of methods and fields suggests sufficient modularization for its current scope."
