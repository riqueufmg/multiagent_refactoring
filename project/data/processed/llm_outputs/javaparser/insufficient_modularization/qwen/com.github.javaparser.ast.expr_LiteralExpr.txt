    "justification": "The class has 8 methods with a WMC of 8, indicating low complexity. With only 34 lines of code and 0 fields, the class is already small and focused. The DIT of 4 suggests reasonable inheritance depth. The class appears to be sufficiently modularized with appropriate size and complexity for its purpose."
