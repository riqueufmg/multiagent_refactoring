    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithName",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 15 lines of code (loc=15), which indicates a small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=4) is low, suggesting low complexity. The class appears to be well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization based on its size and complexity metrics."
