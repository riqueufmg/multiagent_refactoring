    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ModuleDirectiveMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=0) and 11 lines of code (loc=11), which indicates a very small and simple class. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting minimal complexity. With only 5 nested classes (nc=5) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low complexity and small size indicate proper modularization."
