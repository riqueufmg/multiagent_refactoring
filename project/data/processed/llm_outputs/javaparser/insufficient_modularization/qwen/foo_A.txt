```json
{
    "class": "foo.A",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 2 lines of code (loc=2). The Weighted Methods per Class is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies to other classes (fanout=0). This indicates a minimal, well-modularized class that does not require further decomposition."
