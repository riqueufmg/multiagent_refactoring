    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ModuleProvidesDirectiveMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), minimal fields (nof=2), and low lines of code (loc=10). The lack of inheritance complexity (dit=3) and good cohesion (lcom=0.0) indicate sufficient modularization. No external dependencies or fan-in/fan-out relationships suggest this is a well-contained, simple class that does not require further decomposition."
