    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarators.AbstractSymbolDeclarator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=1, LOC=11, NOM=1) and minimal dependencies (only one dependency on TypeSolver). With only 2 fields and 1 method, the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low number of responsibilities and simple structure indicate proper modularization."
