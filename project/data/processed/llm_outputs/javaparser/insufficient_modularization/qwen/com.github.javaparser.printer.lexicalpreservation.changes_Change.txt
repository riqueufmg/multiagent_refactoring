    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.changes.Change",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 20 lines of code (loc=20), which indicates a small and focused class. The weighted method count (wmc=8) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 5 direct dependencies (nc=5) and no fan-in or fan-out, the class appears to have a single responsibility and is appropriately modularized. The lack of public fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and public methods (nopm=0) suggests proper encapsulation. The negative LCOM value (lcom=-1.0) may indicate high cohesion within the small method set."
