    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.other.GrammarLetterGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3) with 1 public method (nopm=1), low complexity (wmc=9), and minimal size (loc=48). The low number of methods and low cyclomatic complexity indicate sufficient modularization. No field declarations (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies suggest a simple, well-decomposed class that does not require further decomposition."
