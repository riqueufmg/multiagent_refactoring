{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.chunks.ModifierValidator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high WMC (44) indicating high complexity, 18 methods (NOM) which is relatively high, and 168 lines of code (LOC) suggesting it handles too many responsibilities. The LCOM value of 0.6666666666666666 indicates poor cohesion, and the class depends on 15 other classes, suggesting it orchestrates multiple concerns that could be better decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
