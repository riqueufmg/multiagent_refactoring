    "class": "com.github.javaparser.JavaParserAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 33 methods (nom=33) with 32 public methods (nopm=32), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 34, which is high and suggests high complexity. The class depends on 25 external classes (dependencies), showing it has many external relationships. The LOC is 116, which combined with the high number of methods indicates dense functionality. LCOM value of 0.0606 suggests some cohesion issues. These metrics collectively indicate that the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and complexity."
