    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ConditionalExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), small size (loc=11), and minimal fields (nof=3). The lack of inheritance complexity (dit=3 but only 1 method) and absence of coupling issues (fanin=0, fanout=0, lcom=0.0) indicate sufficient modularization. The class appears to be properly decomposed for its functionality."
