    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedLambdaConstraintType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 8 methods (nom=8) and 7 public methods (nopm=7), low WMC (8), and relatively small size with 27 lines of code (loc=27). The LCOM value of 0.375 indicates good cohesion, and the class has only 1 field (nof=1) with no public fields (nopf=0). The low number of methods and fields, combined with good cohesion and low complexity metrics, suggests the class is sufficiently modularized."
