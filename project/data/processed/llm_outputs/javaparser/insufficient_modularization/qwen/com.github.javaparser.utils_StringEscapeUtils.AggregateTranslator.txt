    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.StringEscapeUtils.AggregateTranslator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), 26 lines of code (loc=26), and no dependencies. The low number of methods and fields indicates minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure or utility component with insufficient complexity to exhibit insufficient modularization smell."
