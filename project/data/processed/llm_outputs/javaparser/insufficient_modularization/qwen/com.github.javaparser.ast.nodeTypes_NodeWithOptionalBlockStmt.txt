    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithOptionalBlockStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4) and 13 lines of code (loc=13), which indicates a very small and simple class. The low complexity metrics suggest that further decomposition would not provide significant benefits in terms of reducing size or implementation complexity."
