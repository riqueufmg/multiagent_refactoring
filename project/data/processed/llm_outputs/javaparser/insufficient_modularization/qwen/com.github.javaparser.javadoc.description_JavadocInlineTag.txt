    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 9 methods and WMC of 15, which is manageable. It has low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and reasonable size (71 LOC). The LCOM value of 0.222 indicates good cohesion within the class. With only 4 fields and no public fields, the class appears to be well-encapsulated and appropriately modularized for its functionality."
