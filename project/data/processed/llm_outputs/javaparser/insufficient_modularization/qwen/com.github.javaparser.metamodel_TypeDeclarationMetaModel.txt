    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.TypeDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=0), low weight method count (wmc=2), reasonable lines of code (loc=14), and good cohesion (lcom=1.0). The number of fields (nof=3) and parameters (nopf=3) are also within acceptable limits. The depth of inheritance (dit=3) is moderate. Based on these metrics, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already well-decomposed with manageable size and complexity."
