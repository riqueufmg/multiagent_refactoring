    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.CompilationUnitContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 65 which is very high, LOC (Lines of Code) is 241 indicating a large class size, and NOM (Number of Methods) is 15 which is relatively high. These metrics suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
