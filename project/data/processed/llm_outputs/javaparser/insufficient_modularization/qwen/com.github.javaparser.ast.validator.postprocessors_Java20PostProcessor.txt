    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 5 lines of code (loc), no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=0), and minimal structural complexity (wmc=0, dit=11 but this is inheritance depth not complexity). The class appears to be a simple, focused component with minimal implementation complexity that does not require further decomposition."
