    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.NoCommentHashCodeVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=104, nopm=104), high lines of code (loc=319), and a high weighted method count (wmc=105). These metrics indicate high complexity and size, suggesting that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce its complexity and improve maintainability."
