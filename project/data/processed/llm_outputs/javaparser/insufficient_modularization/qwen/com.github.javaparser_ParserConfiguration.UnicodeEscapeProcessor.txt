    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=21 but this appears to be the file location rather than class size), and minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low WMC (0) and DIT (1) indicate minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition."
