{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.SourcePrinter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 19 methods (nom), 34 weighted methods count (wmc), and 181 lines of code (loc). The lack of cohesion (lcom = 0.21) suggests poor internal structure, and the presence of 8 fields (nof) with only 13 public methods (nopm) indicates a complex internal state that could benefit from decomposition. The class manages multiple responsibilities including printing configuration, indentation handling, and position tracking, suggesting insufficient modularization."
