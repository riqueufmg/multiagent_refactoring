    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedMethodDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with WMC of 11 and 6 methods, but the LOC is only 39 which indicates reasonable size. The class has no fields (NOF=0) and no public methods (NOPM=0), suggesting it may be an interface or abstract class. With only 6 methods and relatively low complexity metrics, there is no strong evidence of insufficient modularization requiring further decomposition."
