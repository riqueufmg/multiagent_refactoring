    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.VariableDeclarationExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 25 methods (nom), 45 weighted method count (wmc), and 162 lines of code (loc). The high number of methods and weighted method complexity suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce implementation complexity. The class also has a moderate afferent coupling (fanin=0) and efferent coupling (fanout=0) but the internal complexity metrics indicate insufficient modularization."
