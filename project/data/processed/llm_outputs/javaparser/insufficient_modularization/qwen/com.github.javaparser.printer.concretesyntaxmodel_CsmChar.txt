    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmChar",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4, wmc=4), 17 lines of code (loc=17), and implements a single responsibility with no fields (nof=1, nc=0). The low number of methods and lines of code indicate proper modularization for a class with a focused purpose."
