    "class": "com.github.javaparser.Range",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 22 methods (nom=22) and 170 lines of code (loc=170), which is within reasonable limits for a single class. The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 28, indicating moderate complexity. The LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) is 0.0909090909090909, which is very low and indicates high cohesion among methods. The class has minimal dependencies with only one dependency on Position class. While the class has a reasonable number of methods, the low LCOM value suggests good internal cohesion and the metrics do not indicate sufficient evidence of insufficient modularization."
