    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 0 fields (nof=0), and 11 lines of code (loc=11), indicating it is already highly modularized. The low complexity metrics suggest the class is properly decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
