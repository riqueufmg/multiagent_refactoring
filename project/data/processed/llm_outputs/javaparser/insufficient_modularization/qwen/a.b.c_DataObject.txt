    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 lines of code (loc=2), no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), and no dependencies. The metrics indicate a minimal class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it has not grown beyond a simple data object."
