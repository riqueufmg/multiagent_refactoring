    "class": "com.github.javaparser.Provider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 0 fields (nof=0), and 14 lines of code (loc=14). The low number of methods and fields indicates minimal complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple, well-encapsulated unit with no signs of insufficient modularization."
