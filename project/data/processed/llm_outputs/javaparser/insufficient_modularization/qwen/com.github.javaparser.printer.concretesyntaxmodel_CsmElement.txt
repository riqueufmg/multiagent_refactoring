    "justification": "The class has 30 methods (nom=30, wmc=30) and 90 lines of code (loc=90), indicating high implementation complexity. With 16 nested classes (nc=16) and no fields (nof=0), the class appears to be a large, complex container that could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
