    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java22Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 2 fields (nof=2), with a low weighted method count (wmc=3) and low lines of code (loc=61). The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure indicate it is already well modularized. The depth of inheritance tree (dit=25) suggests it inherits from a deep hierarchy but this does not indicate insufficient modularization in the class itself."
