    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 lines of code and no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), indicating it is already minimally implemented and does not exhibit complexity that would require further decomposition. The lack of methods and minimal size suggest it is sufficiently modularized for its current purpose."
