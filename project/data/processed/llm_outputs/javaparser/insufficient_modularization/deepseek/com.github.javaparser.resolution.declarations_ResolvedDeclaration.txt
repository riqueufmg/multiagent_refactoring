    "justification": "The class has 0 fields and 15 methods, indicating it is a pure interface or abstract class with only method declarations. Its LOC (94) and WMC (15) are low, and it has no internal complexity to decompose. The dependencies are all other declaration types, suggesting it is a root of a hierarchy, which is appropriately modularized."
