    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.quality.NotNullGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) with 2 public methods (nopm=2) and a weighted method complexity of 18 (wmc=18) indicating moderate complexity. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) suggests it's purely procedural, and the high negative LCOM (-1.0) confirms all methods are independent, making them candidates for separate utility classes or decomposition into focused helper classes."
