    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low LOC (80), moderate WMC (20), and low LCOM (0.389), indicating cohesive behavior. It has 18 methods but all are public (nopm=18), suggesting a focused interface. No fields (nof=3, nopf=0) and no dependencies beyond inheritance and required types, showing minimal complexity. Further decomposition is not justified."
