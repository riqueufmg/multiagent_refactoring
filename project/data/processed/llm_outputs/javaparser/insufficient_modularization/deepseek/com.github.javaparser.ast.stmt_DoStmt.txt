    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.DoStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=23, LOC=89) and minimal fields (NOF=2). It shows high cohesion (LCOM=0.625) and no excessive dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The number of methods (NOM=16) is moderate and primarily consists of public methods (NOPM=16), typical for an AST node class with visitor patterns, indicating appropriate modularization for its role."
