    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.AstObserverAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 10 lines of code (loc=10), with a low weighted method count (wmc=4). All methods are public (nopm=4), indicating a simple, focused interface. The lack of fields (nof=0) and low complexity metrics suggest the class is already sufficiently modularized."
