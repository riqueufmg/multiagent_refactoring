    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.TraditionalJavadocComment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) but 0 fields (nof=0), indicating it is already focused on behavior rather than state. With 52 lines of code (loc=52) and 14 weighted methods (wmc=14), the class is small and not overly complex. The lack of fields suggests no internal state that could be decomposed into separate concerns. The LCOM value of -1.0 indicates high method cohesion. No evidence suggests further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
