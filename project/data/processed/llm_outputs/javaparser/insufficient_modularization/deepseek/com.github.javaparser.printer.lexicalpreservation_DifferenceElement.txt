{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.DifferenceElement",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=24, WMC=9, NC=4) and minimal dependencies, with no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and only 9 methods (nom=9) that are all public (nopm=0). The LCOM value of -1.0 indicates high cohesion. These characteristics suggest the class is already appropriately modularized."
