    "justification": "Class has 6 methods (nom) and 118 lines of code (loc), indicating moderate size and complexity. The LCOM value of 0.33 suggests some cohesion, but the class handles multiple responsibilities such as generating property methods and managing different node types (e.g., ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, EnumDeclaration, EnumConstantDeclaration), which could be separated into distinct modules to reduce implementation complexity."
