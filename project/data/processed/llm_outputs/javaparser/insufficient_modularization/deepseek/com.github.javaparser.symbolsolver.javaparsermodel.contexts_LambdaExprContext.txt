    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.LambdaExprContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 7 methods (nom=7) with 5 public methods (nopm=5) and 136 lines of code (loc=136), indicating moderate size and complexity. The high weighted method count (wmc=32) suggests complex methods, and the negative LCOM (-1.0) indicates low cohesion, which together suggest insufficient decomposition where responsibilities could be further separated into smaller, more focused modules."
