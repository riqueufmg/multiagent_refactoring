{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParserBase",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: 35 methods (nom=35), 77 weighted methods per class (wmc=77), and 345 lines of code (loc=345). It depends on 22 external types, indicating it handles multiple responsibilities. The low LCOM (0.29) suggests high cohesion, but the large size and high method count indicate insufficient decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
