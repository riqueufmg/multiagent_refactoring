    "justification": "Class has 9 fields (nof=9) and only 4 methods (nom=4), indicating high data-to-behavior ratio. LCOM=0.5 suggests moderate cohesion, and 127 LOC with 7 WMC shows implementation complexity that could be reduced through decomposition of field management or iterator creation logic."
