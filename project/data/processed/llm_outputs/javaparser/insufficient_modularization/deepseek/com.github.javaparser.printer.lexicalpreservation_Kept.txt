    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.Kept",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16) with 74 lines of code (loc=74) and a weighted method complexity of 23 (wmc=23), indicating significant implementation complexity. The low cohesion (lcom=0.25) suggests multiple responsibilities, and the high number of methods relative to fields (nof=1) further supports that the class is handling multiple concerns without sufficient decomposition."
