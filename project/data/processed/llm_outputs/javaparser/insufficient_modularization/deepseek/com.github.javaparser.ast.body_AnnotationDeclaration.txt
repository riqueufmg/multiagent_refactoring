    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.AnnotationDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) and 52 lines of code (loc=52), which is relatively small. It has no fields (nof=0), indicating no internal state to decompose. The weighted method complexity (wmc=14) suggests low per-method complexity. The lack of fields and low size/complexity does not indicate a need for further decomposition."
