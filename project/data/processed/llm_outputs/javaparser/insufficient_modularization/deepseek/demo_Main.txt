    "justification": "The class has 2 methods (nom=2) with only 1 being public (nopm=1), indicating a mix of concerns. It has 4 weighted methods per class (wmc=4) and 31 lines of code (loc=31), suggesting moderate complexity. The class depends on 4 external types and contains an inner class (demo.Main.Callback), showing multiple responsibilities that could be separated into dedicated classes."
