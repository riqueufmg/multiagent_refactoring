    "justification": "The class has 22 methods (nom) and a weighted method complexity of 47 (wmc), indicating high implementation complexity. It also has 132 lines of code (loc) and a lack of cohesion (lcom) of 0.32, suggesting multiple responsibilities. The class extends GenericVisitorAdapter and overrides many visitor methods for different statement types, which could be decomposed into separate, more focused classes or helper methods."
