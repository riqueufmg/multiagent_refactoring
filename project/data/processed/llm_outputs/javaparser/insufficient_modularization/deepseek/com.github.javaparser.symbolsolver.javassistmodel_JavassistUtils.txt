    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 12 methods (nom=12) with 156 lines of code (loc=156) and weighted method complexity of 39 (wmc=39), indicating high implementation complexity that could be reduced through further decomposition. The lack of fields (nof=0) and negative LCOM (-1.0) suggests it's a utility class with multiple unrelated methods that could be grouped into separate, more cohesive classes."
