    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedPrimitiveType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 21 methods (nom=21) with 39 weighted methods per class (wmc=39) and 128 lines of code (loc=128), indicating high implementation complexity. The lack of child classes (nc=0) and low depth of inheritance (dit=1) suggest insufficient decomposition. The LCOM value of 0.52 shows moderate cohesion, suggesting further decomposition could improve modularity."
