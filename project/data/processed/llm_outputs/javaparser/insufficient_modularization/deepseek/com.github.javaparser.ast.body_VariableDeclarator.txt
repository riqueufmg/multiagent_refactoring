    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.VariableDeclarator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High method count (nom=23) and high weighted method complexity (wmc=45) indicate significant implementation complexity. Moderate lack of cohesion (lcom=0.304) suggests multiple responsibilities. The class has 3 fields but 23 methods, suggesting it handles multiple concerns that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
