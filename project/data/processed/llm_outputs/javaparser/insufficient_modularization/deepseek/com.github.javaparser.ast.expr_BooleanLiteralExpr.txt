    "justification": "Class has low complexity (WMC=15, LOC=62, NOM=14) and no fields (NOF=1, NOPF=0) indicating minimal state. LCOM=0.714 suggests moderate cohesion, but the class is already small and focused on representing a boolean literal, with no clear decomposition opportunities based on provided metrics."
