    "justification": "High LOC (592) and WMC (63) indicate large size and complexity. Moderate LCOM (0.21) suggests some cohesion, but the high number of methods (14) and fields (5) with significant dependencies (24) suggests the class handles multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
