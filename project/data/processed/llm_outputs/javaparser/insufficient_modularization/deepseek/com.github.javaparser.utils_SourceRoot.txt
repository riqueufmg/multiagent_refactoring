    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: 40 methods (nom), 453 lines of code (loc), and 59 weighted methods per class (wmc). It contains inner classes (ParallelParse, Callback, VisitFileCallback) and multiple dependencies, indicating it handles multiple responsibilities such as parsing, file traversal, and callback management that could be decomposed into separate classes."
