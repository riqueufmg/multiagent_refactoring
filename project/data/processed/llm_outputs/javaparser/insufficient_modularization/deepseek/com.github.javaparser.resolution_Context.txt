    "justification": "The class has 26 methods (nom=26) and 214 lines of code (loc=214), indicating high implementation complexity and size that could be reduced through further decomposition. The lack of fields (nof=0) suggests it may be a utility class with many methods that could be grouped into separate, more focused classes."
