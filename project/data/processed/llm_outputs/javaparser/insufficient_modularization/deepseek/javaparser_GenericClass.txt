    "justification": "Class has 8 methods (nom=8) with high lack of cohesion (lcom=1.0) and moderate size (loc=31), suggesting insufficient decomposition despite having an inner class dependency. The high method count relative to size and perfect lack of cohesion indicates multiple responsibilities that could be separated."
