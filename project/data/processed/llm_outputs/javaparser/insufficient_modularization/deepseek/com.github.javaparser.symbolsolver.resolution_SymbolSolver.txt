    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.SymbolSolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) and a weighted method count of 26 (wmc=26), indicating high implementation complexity. The lack of decomposition is evident as all methods are public (nopm=14) and the class has no children (nc=0), suggesting it could be split into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
