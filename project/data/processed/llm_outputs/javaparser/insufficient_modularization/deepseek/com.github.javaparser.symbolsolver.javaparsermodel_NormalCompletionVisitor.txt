    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.NormalCompletionVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High WMC (43) and LOC (198) indicate significant complexity. High LCOM (0.833) suggests low cohesion among methods. The class has 18 methods with only 2 public, indicating many internal methods that could be grouped separately. The lack of fields (nof=1) combined with many methods suggests procedural grouping rather than object-oriented decomposition."
