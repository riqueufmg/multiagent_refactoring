    "justification": "Class has 6 methods (nom=6) and 129 lines of code (loc=129), indicating moderate size and complexity. It contains 4 inner classes (nof=4) and depends on 11 external types, suggesting it handles multiple distinct serialization concerns (e.g., JsonRange, JsonNode, JsonToken, JsonTokenRange) that could be decomposed into separate classes to reduce implementation complexity and improve modularity."
