    "justification": "Class has low complexity (WMC=10, LOC=44, NOM=10) with zero dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no child classes (NC=0). All methods are public (NOPM=10), suggesting a focused, cohesive interface. LCOM=0.7 indicates moderate cohesion, but overall metrics do not suggest insufficient modularization."
