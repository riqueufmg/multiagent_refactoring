    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High method count (nom=23) and complexity (wmc=39) indicate significant implementation complexity. Moderate lack of cohesion (lcom=0.52) suggests multiple responsibilities. The class has no fan-in or fan-out, indicating it is not heavily reused, making decomposition less risky."
