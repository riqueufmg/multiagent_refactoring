    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=82, WMC=9, nom=7, nopm=7) and no indication of insufficient modularization. It has only 2 fields and 7 methods, all public, with zero LCOM suggesting good cohesion. No evidence suggests further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
