    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High method count (nom=27) and high complexity (wmc=56) indicate the class handles multiple responsibilities. Low cohesion (lcom=0.222) suggests methods are loosely related, and the presence of an inner class (TypeSubstitution) shows partial decomposition that could be extended."
