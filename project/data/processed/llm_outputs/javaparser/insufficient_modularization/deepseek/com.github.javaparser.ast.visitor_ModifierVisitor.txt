    "justification": "The class has 105 methods (nom) with 103 public methods (nopm), 1049 lines of code (loc), and a weighted method complexity of 178 (wmc). These metrics indicate a very large and complex class that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused units to reduce size and implementation complexity."
