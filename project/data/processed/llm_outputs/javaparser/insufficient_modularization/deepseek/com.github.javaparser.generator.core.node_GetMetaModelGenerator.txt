    "justification": "Class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 11 lines of code (loc=11), which is small and simple. It has no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and minimal complexity (wmc=2). The class is already highly focused with no indication of multiple responsibilities that would require further decomposition."
