    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2), 6 lines of code (loc=6), and a weighted method complexity of 2 (wmc=2), indicating minimal size and complexity. No fields (nof=0) or dependencies suggest limited responsibility. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
