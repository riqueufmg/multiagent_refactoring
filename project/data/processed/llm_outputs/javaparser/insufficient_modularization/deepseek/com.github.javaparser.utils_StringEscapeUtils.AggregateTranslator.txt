    "justification": "The class has only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), and 26 lines of code (loc=26), which indicates minimal size and complexity. No methods or dependencies suggest it is already a simple, focused class. Further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity meaningfully."
