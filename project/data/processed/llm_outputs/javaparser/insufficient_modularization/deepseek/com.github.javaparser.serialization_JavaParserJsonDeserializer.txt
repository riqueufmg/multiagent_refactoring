    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) and 1 public method (nopm=1) with a high WMC (22) and LOC (126), indicating significant implementation complexity concentrated in a single class. The lack of decomposition is evident from the absence of child classes (nc=0) and the negative LCOM (-1.0) suggests highly cohesive methods, which could be grouped into separate helper classes to reduce size and complexity."
