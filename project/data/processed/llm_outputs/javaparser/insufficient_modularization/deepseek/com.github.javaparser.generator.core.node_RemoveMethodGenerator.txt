    "justification": "Class has only 5 methods with 60 LOC and 12 WMC, indicating small size and low complexity. No fields (nof=0, nopf=0) suggest minimal state management. Single public method (nopm=1) shows focused responsibility. LCOM=-1 indicates no cohesion issues. These metrics do not suggest insufficient modularization."
