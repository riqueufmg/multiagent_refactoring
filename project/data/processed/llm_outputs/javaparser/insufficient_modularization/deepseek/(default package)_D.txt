    "class": "(default package).D",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class D has only 2 fields, 1 method, 8 lines of code, and a weighted method complexity of 1. The low field count, method count, LOC, and WMC indicate minimal implementation complexity. LCOM of 0.0 suggests good cohesion. No dependencies indicate no external complexity. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
