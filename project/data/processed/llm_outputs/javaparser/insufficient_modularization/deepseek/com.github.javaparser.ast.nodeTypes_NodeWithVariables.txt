    "justification": "Class has 10 methods (nom=10) and 22 weighted methods per class (wmc=22), indicating high implementation complexity. It has 4 inner classes (nc=4) and a negative LCOM (-1.0), suggesting low cohesion. The presence of multiple inner classes and many methods in a single class suggests insufficient decomposition."
