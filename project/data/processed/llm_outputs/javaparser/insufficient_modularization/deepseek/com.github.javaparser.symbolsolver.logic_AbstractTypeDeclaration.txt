    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=54, WMC=8, NC=25, NOM=3) with no fields (NOF=0, NOPF=0) and only 3 public methods. All methods are public (NOPM=3), indicating focused functionality. The class shows high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0) and minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0, 1 dependency). No evidence suggests further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
