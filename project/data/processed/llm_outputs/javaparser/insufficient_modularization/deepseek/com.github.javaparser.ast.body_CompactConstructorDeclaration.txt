    "justification": "Class has high complexity metrics: 29 methods (nom=29), 237 lines of code (loc=237), and weighted method complexity of 59 (wmc=59). The lack of fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests all functionality is contained within this single class rather than delegated to collaborators."
