    "justification": "The class has 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and 15 methods (nom=15, nopm=15), indicating it is already highly focused on behavior without internal state. The LOC (64) and WMC (16) are low, suggesting minimal implementation complexity. No dependencies indicate high cohesion, and further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity."
