    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=17, LOC=60), high cohesion (LCOM=0.18), and no fields (NOF=2, NOPF=0) or methods (NOM=11, NOPM=11) that suggest excessive responsibility. All methods are public, indicating a focused interface, and dependencies are minimal and directly related to its purpose."
