    "justification": "Class has 14 methods (nom=14) and 113 lines of code (loc=113), indicating significant implementation complexity that could be reduced through decomposition. The lack of child classes (nc=0) and moderate weighted method count (wmc=23) suggest the class handles multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused modules."
