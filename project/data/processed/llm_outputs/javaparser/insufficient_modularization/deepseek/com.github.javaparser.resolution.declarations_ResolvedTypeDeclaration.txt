    "justification": "Class has 25 methods (nom=25) and 144 lines of code (loc=144) with high weighted method count (wmc=26), indicating significant implementation complexity that could be reduced through further decomposition. The class serves as a common interface for multiple specialized type declarations (7 dependencies), suggesting it may be handling responsibilities that could be better separated."
