    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=20, LOC=89, NC=2) and high cohesion (LCOM=0.93 indicates low cohesion, but the class is small and focused on representing a long literal). It has no fan-in or fan-out, and all methods are public (NOPM=15, NOM=15), suggesting it is already a minimal, well-defined unit. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
