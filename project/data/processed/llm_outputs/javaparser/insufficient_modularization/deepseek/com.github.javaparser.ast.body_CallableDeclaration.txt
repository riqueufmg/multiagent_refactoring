    "justification": "Class has high metrics: LOC=293, WMC=71, NOM=30, NOF=8, indicating large size and complexity. LCOM=0.33 suggests moderate cohesion, and DIT=4 shows inheritance depth, but the high method count and complexity suggest insufficient decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
