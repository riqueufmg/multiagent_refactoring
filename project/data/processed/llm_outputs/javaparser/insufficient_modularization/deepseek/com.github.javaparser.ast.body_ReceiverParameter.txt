    "justification": "Class has moderate size (128 LOC, 17 methods) with low complexity (WMC=31, LCOM=0.35) and no indication of multiple responsibilities. All methods are public (nopm=17), suggesting cohesive interface. No excessive dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth (DIT=3) is reasonable."
