    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has high complexity metrics: LOC=324, WMC=88, and LCOM=0.533 indicating low cohesion. It has 15 methods with only 2 fields, suggesting multiple responsibilities concentrated in one class. The high number of dependencies (28) further indicates the class is handling many concerns without sufficient decomposition."
