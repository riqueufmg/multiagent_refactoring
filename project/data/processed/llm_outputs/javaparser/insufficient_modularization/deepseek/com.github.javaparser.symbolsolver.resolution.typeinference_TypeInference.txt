    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High method count (nom=21) and high complexity (wmc=69) indicate the class handles multiple responsibilities. The large number of dependencies (23) suggests it interacts with many external types, and the moderate LCOM (0.14) shows some cohesion but not enough to justify the size and complexity without further decomposition."
