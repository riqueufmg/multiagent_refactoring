    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics: only 2 methods (nom=2), 14 lines of code (loc=14), and 2 weighted methods per class (wmc=2). It has no fields (nof=0) and minimal dependencies. These characteristics indicate the class is already small and simple, showing no signs of insufficient modularization."
