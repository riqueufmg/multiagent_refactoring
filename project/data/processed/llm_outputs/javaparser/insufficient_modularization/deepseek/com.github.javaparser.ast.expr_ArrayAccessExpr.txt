    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=23, LOC=89, NOM=16) and no fields (NOF=2, NOPF=0) indicating minimal state. LCOM=0.625 suggests moderate cohesion, but the class is already specialized (inherits from Expression) and shows no clear signs of insufficient decomposition given its size and responsibility."
