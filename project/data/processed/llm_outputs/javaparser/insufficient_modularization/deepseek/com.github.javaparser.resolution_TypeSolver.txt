    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=13, LOC=62) and a small number of methods (NOM=10). It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating it is already a focused, self-contained unit. No evidence suggests further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
