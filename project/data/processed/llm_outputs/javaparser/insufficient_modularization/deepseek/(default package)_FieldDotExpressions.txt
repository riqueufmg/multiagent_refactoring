    "justification": "Class has only 1 method (nom=1) and 7 lines of code (loc=7), which is small and simple. It has no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and minimal complexity (wmc=1). The single dependency is likely required for its functionality, and further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity."
