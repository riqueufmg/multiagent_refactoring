    "justification": "Class has 10 fields (nof=10) and only 4 methods (nom=4), with high LCOM (1.0) indicating low cohesion. The class contains inner classes (dependencies show CharSequenceTranslator and LookupTranslator) suggesting it combines multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes."
