    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.SynchronizedStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=23, LOC=89) and moderate size (NOM=16). It has zero NC and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating it is already a focused unit. LCOM=0.625 suggests moderate cohesion, but the overall metrics do not strongly indicate insufficient modularization."
