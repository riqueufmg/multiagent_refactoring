    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.IntersectionType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom) and 92 lines of code (loc), which are moderate. It has no fields (nof=1 indicates one field, but nopf=0 indicates no private fields), low weighted method complexity (wmc=26), and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.67). The dependencies are typical for an AST node class. The size and complexity do not strongly indicate insufficient modularization."
