    "justification": "High method count (nom=19) and moderate LCOM (0.63) indicate potential grouping of unrelated responsibilities. The class has 19 public methods (nopm=19) and a weighted method complexity of 27, suggesting it may be handling multiple concerns that could be separated into smaller, more focused modules."
