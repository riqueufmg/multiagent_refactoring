    "justification": "The class has 20 methods (nom=20) and 28 conditional branches (nc=28) with a high weighted method count (wmc=20), indicating significant implementation complexity that could be reduced through decomposition. The lack of fields (nof=0) suggests it's a behavioral class that could be split into more focused units."
