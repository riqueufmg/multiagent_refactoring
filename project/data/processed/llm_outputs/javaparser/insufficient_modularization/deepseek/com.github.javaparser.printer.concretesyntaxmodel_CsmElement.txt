    "justification": "High number of methods (nom=30) and weighted methods per class (wmc=30) indicate significant implementation complexity. The class has 16 distinct conditions (nc=16) and 90 lines of code (loc=90), suggesting it may be handling multiple responsibilities. The lack of public fields (nopf=0) and methods (nopm=0) does not offset the high internal complexity, which could be reduced by further decomposition."
