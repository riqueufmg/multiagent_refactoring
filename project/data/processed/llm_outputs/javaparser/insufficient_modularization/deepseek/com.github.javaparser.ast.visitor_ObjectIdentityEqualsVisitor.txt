    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.ObjectIdentityEqualsVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 104 methods (nom=104) and 319 lines of code (loc=319), indicating high size and complexity. The lack of cohesion (lcom=1.0) suggests methods are not strongly related, and the high weighted method count (wmc=104) shows each method contributes to complexity. The class depends on 104 external types, suggesting it handles many distinct concerns that could be separated."
