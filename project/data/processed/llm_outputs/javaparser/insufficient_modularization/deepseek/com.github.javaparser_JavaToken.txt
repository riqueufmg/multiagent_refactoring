```json
{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.JavaToken",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: 28 methods (nom=28) with 25 public methods (nopm=25), 404 lines of code (loc=404), and weighted method complexity of 40 (wmc=40). The large number of methods and high LOC indicate insufficient decomposition, suggesting the class could be split into smaller, more focused units to reduce size and complexity."
