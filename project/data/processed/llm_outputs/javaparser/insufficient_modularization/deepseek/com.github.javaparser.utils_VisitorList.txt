    "justification": "Class has 37 methods (nom=37) and 175 lines of code (loc=175), indicating high implementation complexity that could be reduced through decomposition. The lack of child classes (nc=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest it operates in isolation and could be split into smaller, more focused units."
