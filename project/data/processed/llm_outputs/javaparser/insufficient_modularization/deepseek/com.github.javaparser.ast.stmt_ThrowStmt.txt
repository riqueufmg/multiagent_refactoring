    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.ThrowStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=18, LOC=69, NOM=14) and no fields (NOF=1, NOPF=0), indicating it is already focused on a single responsibility. The LCOM value (0.714) suggests some cohesion issues, but the class is small and does not show clear signs of insufficient decomposition."
