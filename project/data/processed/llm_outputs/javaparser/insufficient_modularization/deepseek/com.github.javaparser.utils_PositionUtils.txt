    "justification": "Class has 12 methods (7 public) with 112 LOC and WMC of 31, indicating high complexity and size that could be reduced through decomposition. The negative LCOM value suggests excessive method coupling, and the class serves as a utility with multiple distinct responsibilities across various AST node types."
