    "justification": "Class has minimal complexity with only 2 methods, 11 LOC, and 2 WMC. No fields exist (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating no internal state to decompose. The single public method suggests a focused responsibility. Dependencies are external types required for its function, not indicators of insufficient modularization."
