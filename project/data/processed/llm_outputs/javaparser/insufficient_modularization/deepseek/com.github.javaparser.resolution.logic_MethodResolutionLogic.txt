    "justification": "High LOC (803) and WMC (211) indicate large size and complexity. High number of methods (31) with many public (13) suggests multiple responsibilities. Low LCOM (0.19) suggests high cohesion, but the large scale implies the class could be decomposed into smaller, more focused modules."
