    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedMethodLikeDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (15 methods, 114 LOC, 25 WMC) with no fields, indicating it is already focused on method-like declaration behavior. It has 2 direct children (NC=2) and inherits from a parent (DIT=2), suggesting reasonable decomposition. No dependencies on concrete implementations (fanout=0) and no incoming dependencies (fanin=0) suggest it is already a well-defined interface or abstract class."
