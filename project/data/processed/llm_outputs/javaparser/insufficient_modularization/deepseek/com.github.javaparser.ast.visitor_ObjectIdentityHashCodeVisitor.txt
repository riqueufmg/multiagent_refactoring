    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.ObjectIdentityHashCodeVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 104 methods (nom=104) and 318 lines of code (loc=318), indicating a large and complex class. The lack of cohesion (lcom=1.0) suggests methods are not strongly related, and the high weighted method count (wmc=104) shows significant implementation complexity. The class depends on 94 external types, suggesting it handles many distinct concerns that could be separated."
