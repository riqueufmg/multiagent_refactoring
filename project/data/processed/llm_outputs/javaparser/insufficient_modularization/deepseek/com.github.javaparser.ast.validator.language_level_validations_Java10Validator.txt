    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1) and 13 lines of code (loc=13), which indicates minimal implementation complexity. With 0 fields (nof=1 includes inherited, nopf=0 for private), low WMC (1), and no internal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), it is already sufficiently modularized."
