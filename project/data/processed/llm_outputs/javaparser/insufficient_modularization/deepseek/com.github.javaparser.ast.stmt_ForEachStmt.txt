    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High method count (nom=21) and high weighted method complexity (wmc=31) indicate significant implementation complexity. Low cohesion (lcom=0.476) suggests multiple responsibilities. The class has 126 lines of code and 21 public methods, which could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
