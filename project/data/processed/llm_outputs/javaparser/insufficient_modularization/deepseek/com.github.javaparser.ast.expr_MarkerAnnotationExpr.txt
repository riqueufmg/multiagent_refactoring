    "justification": "Class has 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and 12 methods (nom=12, nopm=12) with low complexity (loc=46, wmc=12). No fields indicate minimal state management, and all methods are public, suggesting a focused, cohesive interface. LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. No dependencies suggest self-contained functionality. Further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity meaningfully."
