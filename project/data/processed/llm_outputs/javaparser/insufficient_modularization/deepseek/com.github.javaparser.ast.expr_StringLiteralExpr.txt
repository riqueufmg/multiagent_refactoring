    "justification": "The class has 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and 14 methods (nom=14, nopm=14) with a low LOC (71) and moderate WMC (14). It shows high cohesion (lcom=-1.0) and no external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The size and complexity are not excessive, and further decomposition is not warranted."
