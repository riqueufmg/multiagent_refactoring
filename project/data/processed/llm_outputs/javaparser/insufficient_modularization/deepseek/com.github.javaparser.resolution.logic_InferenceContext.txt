    "justification": "Class has 7 methods with 4 public methods, 205 lines of code, and weighted method complexity of 58, indicating high implementation complexity that could be reduced through decomposition. The lack of child classes (nc=0) and moderate lack of cohesion (lcom=0.2857) suggest insufficient modularization despite some cohesion."
