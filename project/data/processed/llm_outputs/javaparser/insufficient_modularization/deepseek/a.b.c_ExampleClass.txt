{
    "class": "a.b.c.ExampleClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), 9 lines of code (loc=9), and low complexity (wmc=2). It shows high cohesion (lcom=0.0) and minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already appropriately sized and not overly complex, suggesting no need for further decomposition."
