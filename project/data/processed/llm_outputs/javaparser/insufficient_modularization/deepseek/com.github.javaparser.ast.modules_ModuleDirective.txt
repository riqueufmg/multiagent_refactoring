    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.modules.ModuleDirective",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high method count (nom=44, nopm=44) and high complexity (wmc=44) with zero fields, suggesting it contains many methods that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The lack of fields indicates it may be a utility-like class with many static or behavioral methods that could be better organized."
