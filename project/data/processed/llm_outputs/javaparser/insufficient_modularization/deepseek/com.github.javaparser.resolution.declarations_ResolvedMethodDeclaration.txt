    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=39, WMC=11, NOM=6) with no fields (NOF=0, NOPF=0) and minimal dependencies (fanout=1). It appears to be a focused interface or abstract class defining method signatures without implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
