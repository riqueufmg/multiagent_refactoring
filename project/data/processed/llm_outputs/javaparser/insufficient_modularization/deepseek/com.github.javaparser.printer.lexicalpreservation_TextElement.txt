    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.TextElement",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom=19) with 13 public methods (nopm=13) and only 38 lines of code (loc=38), indicating high method density and potential insufficient decomposition. The weighted methods per class (wmc=19) suggests high implementation complexity relative to its small size, and the negative LCOM value (-1.0) indicates tightly coupled methods that could be separated."
