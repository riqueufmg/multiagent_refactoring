    "justification": "High number of methods (nom=40) and lines of code (loc=397) indicate a large class. Low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.1) suggests many methods are loosely related, and zero dependencies on other classes in the same package (fanin=0, fanout=0) imply all functionality is self-contained, which are signs of insufficient modularization."
