    "class": "foo.Foo",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has only 2 methods (nom=2), 0 fields (nof=0), 8 lines of code (loc=8), and low complexity (wmc=2). No dependencies indicate it is already a simple, focused unit. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
