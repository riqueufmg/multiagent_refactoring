    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.WhileStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=23, LOC=89) and high cohesion (LCOM=0.625). It has no fields (NOF=2, NOPF=0) and only 16 methods (NOM=16, NOPM=16), all public, indicating a focused responsibility. No dependencies suggest excessive coupling or delegation needs. The metrics do not indicate a large, complex class requiring further decomposition."
