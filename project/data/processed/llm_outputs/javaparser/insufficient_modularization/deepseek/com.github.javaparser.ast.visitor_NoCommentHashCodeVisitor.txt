{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.NoCommentHashCodeVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 104 methods (nom=104) and 105 weighted methods per class (wmc=105), indicating very high method count and complexity. It has 319 lines of code (loc=319) and lacks cohesion (lcom=1.0). These metrics suggest the class is large and complex, performing many distinct operations that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes or helper methods."
