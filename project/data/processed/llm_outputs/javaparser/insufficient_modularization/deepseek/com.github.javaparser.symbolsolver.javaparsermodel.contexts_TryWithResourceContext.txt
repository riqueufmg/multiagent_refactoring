    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=20, LOC=57) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). All methods are public (nom=5, nopm=5), indicating focused responsibility. The LCOM value is -1.0, suggesting high cohesion. No evidence suggests further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
