    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.GenericVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 103 methods (nom=103) and 103 weighted methods (wmc=103) with only 109 lines of code (loc=109), indicating a large number of very small methods that could be grouped by functionality. The high number of methods (103) relative to lines of code suggests each method is minimal, potentially following a pattern that could be decomposed into helper classes or strategy patterns based on visitor node types."
