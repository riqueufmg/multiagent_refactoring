    "justification": "High number of methods (nom=31) and lines of code (loc=202) indicate large class size. Moderate lack of cohesion (lcom=0.516) suggests multiple responsibilities. High weighted method complexity (wmc=49) points to implementation complexity. These factors together suggest insufficient modularization."
