    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.LocalClassDeclarationStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=18, LOC=70) and no fields (NOF=1, NOPF=0), with all methods being public (NOM=14, NOPM=14). The LCOM value (0.714) suggests moderate cohesion, but the class is small and focused on a single responsibility (local class declaration), with no indication of excessive size or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
