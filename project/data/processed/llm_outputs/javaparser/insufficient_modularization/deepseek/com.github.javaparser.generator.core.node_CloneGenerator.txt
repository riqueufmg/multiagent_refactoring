    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.node.CloneGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 10 lines of code (loc=10), which indicates minimal implementation complexity. Weighted methods per class (wmc=2) is low, and lack of fields (nof=0) suggests no internal state to decompose. The class appears sufficiently modularized for its current responsibilities."
