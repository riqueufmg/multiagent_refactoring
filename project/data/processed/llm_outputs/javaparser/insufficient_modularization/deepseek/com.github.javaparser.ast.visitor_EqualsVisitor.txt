    "justification": "The class has extremely high metrics: 112 methods (nom), 848 lines of code (loc), and 481 weighted methods per class (wmc). It also has 0.723 LCOM indicating low cohesion. These values suggest the class is large and complex, performing many distinct functions that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused modules."
