    "justification": "Class has only 1 method (nom=1) and 10 lines of code (loc=10), which indicates minimal implementation complexity and small size. No fields (nof=0) and no dependencies suggest the class is already focused on a single responsibility. Further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity meaningfully."
