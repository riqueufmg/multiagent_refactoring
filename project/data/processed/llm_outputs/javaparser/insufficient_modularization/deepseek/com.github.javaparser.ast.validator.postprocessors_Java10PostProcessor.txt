    "justification": "Class has low complexity metrics: only 3 methods (nom=3), 2 fields (nof=2), 29 lines of code (loc=29), and low weighted method count (wmc=4). LCOM=1.0 indicates all methods use all fields, suggesting cohesive behavior. No evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity requiring further decomposition."
