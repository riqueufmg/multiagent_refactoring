    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=18, LOC=58) and a small number of methods (NOM=6, all public). It has no fields (NOF=0) and inherits from a parent (DIT=2), indicating it is already focused on a specific responsibility. No evidence suggests further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
