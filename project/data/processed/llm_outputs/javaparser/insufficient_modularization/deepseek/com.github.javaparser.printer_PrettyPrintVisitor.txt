    "justification": "The class has 122 methods (nom) and 1588 lines of code (loc), indicating excessive size and complexity. The high weighted method count (wmc=346) suggests many complex methods. The low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.016) indicates the class is handling many related but separable concerns, which could be decomposed into smaller, more focused modules."
