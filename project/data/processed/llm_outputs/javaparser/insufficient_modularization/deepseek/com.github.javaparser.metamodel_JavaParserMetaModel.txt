    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 119 fields (nof=119) and 973 lines of code (loc=973), indicating very high size and complexity. It has only 6 methods (nom=6) and 2 public methods (nopm=2), suggesting low method-to-field ratio and insufficient decomposition of responsibilities. The high number of fields with relatively few methods managing them points to insufficient modularization."
