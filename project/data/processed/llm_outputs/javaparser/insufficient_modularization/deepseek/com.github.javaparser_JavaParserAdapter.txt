    "class": "com.github.javaparser.JavaParserAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 33 methods (nom=33) with 32 being public (nopm=32), indicating a large public interface. The weighted method complexity (wmc=34) suggests moderate complexity, but the high number of methods concentrated in a single class with low cohesion (lcom=0.06) and no internal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) shows insufficient decomposition into smaller, more focused modules."
