    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.RemovedGroup",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has high complexity with 16 methods (WMC=33) and 8 fields, but low cohesion (LCOM=0.1875) suggests insufficient grouping of responsibilities. The presence of 4 public methods indicates multiple entry points, while 0 dependencies on other classes suggests all functionality is contained within this single class rather than decomposed into smaller, focused units."
