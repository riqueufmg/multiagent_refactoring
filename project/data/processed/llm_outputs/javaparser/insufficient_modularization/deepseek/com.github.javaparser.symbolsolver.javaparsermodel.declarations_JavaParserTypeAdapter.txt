    "justification": "Class has 12 methods (nom) and 135 lines of code (loc), indicating a significant size and potential for high implementation complexity. The weighted method count (wmc) of 41 suggests high cyclomatic complexity within the methods, which could be reduced by decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
