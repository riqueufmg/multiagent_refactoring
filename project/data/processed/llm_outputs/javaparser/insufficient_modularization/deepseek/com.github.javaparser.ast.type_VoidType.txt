    "justification": "Class has 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and 15 methods (nom=15, nopm=15) with low complexity (loc=55, wmc=15). It shows high cohesion (lcom=-1.0) and no external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The class is already minimal and focused on representing a void type, with no indication of excessive size or complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
