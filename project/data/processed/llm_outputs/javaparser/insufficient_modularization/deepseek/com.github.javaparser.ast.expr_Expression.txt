{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: 177 methods (nom), 536 lines of code (loc), 180 weighted methods per class (wmc), and 71 distinct conditional paths (nc). The lack of decomposition is indicated by a high lack of cohesion (lcom = 0.98) and a large number of public methods (nopm = 175) in a single class, suggesting it could be broken down into smaller, more cohesive units."
