    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.promotion.BooleanConditionalExprHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2) and 14 lines of code (loc=14), which indicates small size and low complexity. All methods are public (nopm=2), and it has no fields (nof=2 includes inherited fields, but nopf=0 indicates no private fields). The low WMC (3) and zero LCOM suggest minimal internal complexity and good cohesion. No evidence suggests further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
