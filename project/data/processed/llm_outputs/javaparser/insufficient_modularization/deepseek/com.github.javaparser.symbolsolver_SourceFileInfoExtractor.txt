{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.SourceFileInfoExtractor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: 19 methods (nom=19), 38 weighted methods per class (wmc=38), and 145 lines of code (loc=145). It has 8 fields (nof=8) and low cohesion (lcom=0.105), indicating multiple responsibilities. The high method count and complexity suggest insufficient decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
