    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (70 LOC, 13 methods) and complexity (WMC 21), with no fields and a single parent. It implements an observer pattern interface, and its methods likely propagate events, which is a cohesive responsibility. No clear indicators of insufficient modularization, such as high complexity or multiple unrelated responsibilities, are present."
