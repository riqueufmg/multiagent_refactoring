    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=9, LOC=36) and minimal dependencies (fanout=0). It has a moderate number of methods (NOM=6, NOPM=6) but all are public, suggesting a focused interface. The LCOM value is -1, indicating high cohesion. No fields (NOF=0) exist, so further decomposition is not warranted."
