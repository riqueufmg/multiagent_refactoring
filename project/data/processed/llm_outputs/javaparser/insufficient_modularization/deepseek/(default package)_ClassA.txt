    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ClassA has minimal complexity metrics (nof=1, nopf=1, nom=0, nopm=0, loc=3, wmc=0, nc=0, lcom=-1.0). The class is already small and simple with no methods and only 3 lines of code, indicating it is sufficiently modularized. Further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity."
