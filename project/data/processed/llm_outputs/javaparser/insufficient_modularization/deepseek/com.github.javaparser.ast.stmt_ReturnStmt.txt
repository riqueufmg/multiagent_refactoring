    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.ReturnStmt",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High number of methods (nom=17) and high weighted method count (wmc=25) indicate significant implementation complexity. Moderate lack of cohesion (lcom=0.59) suggests multiple responsibilities. The class has no fields (nof=1, nopf=0), meaning all methods operate on a single inherited field, further indicating insufficient decomposition of behavior."
