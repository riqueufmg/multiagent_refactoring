    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ParserConfiguration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 21 fields and 28 methods with 339 lines of code, indicating high complexity and size that could be reduced through decomposition. The low LCOM value (0.25) suggests good cohesion, but the high method count (28) and field count (21) still represent implementation complexity that could benefit from modularization."
