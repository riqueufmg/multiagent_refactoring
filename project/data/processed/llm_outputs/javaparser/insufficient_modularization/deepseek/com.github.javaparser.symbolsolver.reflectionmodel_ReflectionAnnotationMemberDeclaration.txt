    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionAnnotationMemberDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=12, LOC=69), low number of methods (NOM=5), and low number of fields (NOF=3). LCOM=0 indicates good cohesion, and there is no evidence of high implementation complexity or size that suggests insufficient decomposition."
