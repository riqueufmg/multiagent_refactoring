    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 6 methods (nom=6) and 161 lines of code (loc=161), indicating moderate size and complexity. The presence of an inner class (MatchClassification) and dependencies on multiple external classes suggests multiple responsibilities. The lack of decomposition (nof=2, nopf=0) and high weighted method count (wmc=38) indicate that further modularization could reduce implementation complexity."
