    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=20, LOC=85, NOM=16) and high cohesion (LCOM=0.6875). It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inherits from a deep hierarchy (DIT=4), indicating it is already a focused, modular unit. No clear indicators suggest further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
