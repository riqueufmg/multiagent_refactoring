    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 30 methods (29 public) and 42 weighted methods per class (WMC), indicating many responsibilities. Low cohesion (LCOM=0.5) suggests multiple unrelated functionalities. The class depends on 19 external types, further indicating it handles diverse concerns that could be separated into smaller, more focused modules."
