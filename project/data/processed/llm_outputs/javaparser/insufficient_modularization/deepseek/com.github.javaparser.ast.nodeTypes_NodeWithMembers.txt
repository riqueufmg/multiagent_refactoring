    "justification": "High method count (nom=37) and high WMC (37) indicate significant implementation complexity. The class has zero fields (nof=0, nopf=0), suggesting it is a pure behavioral interface or abstract class that aggregates many member-related methods, which could be decomposed into smaller, more focused units."
