    "justification": "Class has high complexity (WMC=37, LOC=134, 23 methods) and moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.52), suggesting insufficient decomposition despite having only 2 fields. The number of methods (23) indicates multiple responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused modules."
