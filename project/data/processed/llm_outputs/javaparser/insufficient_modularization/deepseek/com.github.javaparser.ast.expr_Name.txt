    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Name",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 19 methods (nom=19) and 115 lines of code (loc=115), indicating substantial implementation complexity. The lack of fields (nof=2) relative to many methods suggests insufficient decomposition of responsibilities. The weighted methods per class (wmc=29) is high, and the lack of child classes (nc=0) despite being in a deep inheritance hierarchy (dit=3) suggests the class may be handling too many concerns rather than delegating to specialized subclasses."
