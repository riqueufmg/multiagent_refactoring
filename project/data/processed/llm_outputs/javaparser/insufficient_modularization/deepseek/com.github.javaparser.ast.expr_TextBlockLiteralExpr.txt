    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.TextBlockLiteralExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom) with 15 public methods (nopm), 105 lines of code (loc), and a weighted method complexity (wmc) of 21. These metrics indicate moderate size and complexity. The lack of fields (nof=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest the class is already focused on a single responsibility. No clear indicators of insufficient modularization are present."
