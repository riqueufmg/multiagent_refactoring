    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.SwitchExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 18 methods (nom=18) and 110 lines of code (loc=110), indicating substantial implementation complexity. The lack of decomposition is evidenced by 0 non-public fields (nopf=0) and 0 non-public methods (nopm=0), suggesting all functionality is exposed at the class level without internal modularization. The LCOM value of 0.56 indicates moderate cohesion, which could be improved through further decomposition."
