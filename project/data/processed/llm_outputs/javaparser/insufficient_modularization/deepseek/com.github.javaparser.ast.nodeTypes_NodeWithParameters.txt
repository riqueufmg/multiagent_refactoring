    "justification": "Class has 18 methods (nom=18) with 91 lines of code (loc=91) and weighted method complexity of 18 (wmc=18), indicating high implementation complexity that could be reduced through further decomposition. The lack of fields (nof=0, nopf=0) suggests it's a behavioral class with multiple responsibilities that could be separated."
