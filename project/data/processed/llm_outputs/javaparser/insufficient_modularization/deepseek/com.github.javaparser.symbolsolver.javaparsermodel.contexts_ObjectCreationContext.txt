    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=30, WMC=8, NOM=3) and no fields (NOF=0, NOPF=0), indicating it is already small and focused. The three methods are all public (NOPM=3), suggesting a minimal, cohesive interface. There is no evidence of high implementation complexity or size that would benefit from further decomposition."
