    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1), 0 fields (nof=0), 7 lines of code (loc=7), and 1 weighted method complexity (wmc=1). These metrics indicate minimal size and complexity, showing the class is already sufficiently modularized with no evidence of needing further decomposition."
