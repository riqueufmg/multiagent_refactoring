    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=25, LOC=91) and high cohesion (LCOM=0.74 indicates moderate cohesion, but all methods are public (nom=nopm=19) suggesting focused responsibility). No fields (nof=1, nopf=0) indicate minimal state. Dependencies are standard for AST node classes and do not suggest excessive responsibility."
