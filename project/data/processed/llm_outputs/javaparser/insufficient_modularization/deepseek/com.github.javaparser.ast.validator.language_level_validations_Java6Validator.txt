    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java6Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1) and 8 lines of code (loc=8), which indicates minimal implementation complexity and small size. No fields (nof=0) and no dependencies suggest the class is already highly focused. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
