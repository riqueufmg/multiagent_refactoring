    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=34, WMC=8, NC=9) and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is already small and simple. All methods are public (nom=8, nopm=8), suggesting focused functionality. No evidence suggests further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
