    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 21 methods (nom=21) with 73 lines of code (loc=73) and weighted methods complexity of 23 (wmc=23), indicating high implementation complexity that could be reduced through further decomposition. The lack of child classes (nc=0) and absence of external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest it operates as a monolithic unit."
