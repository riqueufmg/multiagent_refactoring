    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithTypeArguments",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=6, LOC=35, NC=12) and no fields (NOF=0, NOPF=0). It has only 6 methods (NOM=6) with no private methods (NOPM=0), indicating a focused, cohesive interface. The LCOM value is -1.0, suggesting high cohesion. No further decomposition is justified based on size or complexity."
