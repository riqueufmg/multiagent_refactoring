    "justification": "High LOC (154) and WMC (38) indicate substantial size and complexity. High number of methods (24) with moderate LCOM (0.42) suggests multiple responsibilities. The class has no fan-in or fan-out, indicating it is a leaf node that could be decomposed to reduce its internal complexity."
