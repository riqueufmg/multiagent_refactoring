    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom) and 188 lines of code (loc), indicating a significant size and implementation complexity. A high weighted method count (wmc=34) suggests complex methods, and the presence of 5 fields (nof) with 0 LCOM indicates tight cohesion, but the overall size and method count suggest it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce complexity."
