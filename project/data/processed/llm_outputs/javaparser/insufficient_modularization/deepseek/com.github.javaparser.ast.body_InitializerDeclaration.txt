    "justification": "The class has moderate size (82 LOC, 16 methods) with low complexity (WMC 21, DIT 4) and no external dependencies (fanin 0, fanout 0). While LCOM (0.625) suggests some cohesion issues, the overall metrics do not indicate significant implementation complexity or excessive size that would require further decomposition."
