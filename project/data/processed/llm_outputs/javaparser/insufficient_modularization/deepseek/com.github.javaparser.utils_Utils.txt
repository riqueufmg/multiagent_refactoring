    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 26 methods (nom=26) with 25 being public (nopm=25), high implementation complexity (wmc=53), and significant size (loc=230), indicating it likely handles multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
