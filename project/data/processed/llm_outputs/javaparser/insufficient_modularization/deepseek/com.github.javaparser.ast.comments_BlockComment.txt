    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.BlockComment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 13 methods (nom=13) and 49 lines of code (loc=49), which are low counts. It has no fields (nof=0), indicating minimal internal state. The weighted method complexity (wmc=13) suggests simple methods. The lack of fields and low complexity indicates the class is already sufficiently modularized."
