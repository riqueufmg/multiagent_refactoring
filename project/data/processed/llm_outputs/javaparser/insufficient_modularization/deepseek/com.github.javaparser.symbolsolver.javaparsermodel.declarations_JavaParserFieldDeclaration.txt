    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=15, LOC=60), high cohesion (LCOM≈0.17), and no fields (NOF=3, NOPF=0) or methods (NOM=12, NOPM=12) that suggest excessive responsibility. The dependencies are focused on its domain, and the class is already well-decomposed with no indication of further decomposition reducing size or complexity."
