    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.BreakStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=25, LOC=95, NOM=17 with all public) and no fields (NOF=1, NOPF=0), indicating it is already a small, focused unit. LCOM=0.588 suggests moderate cohesion, but the class is small and has no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) that would suggest further decomposition is needed or beneficial."
