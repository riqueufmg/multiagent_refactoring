    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=32, LOC=114) and high cohesion (LCOM=0.67). It has no fields (NOF=2, NOPF=0) and all methods are public (NOM=21, NOPM=21), indicating it is a simple data or node class. No evidence suggests further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
