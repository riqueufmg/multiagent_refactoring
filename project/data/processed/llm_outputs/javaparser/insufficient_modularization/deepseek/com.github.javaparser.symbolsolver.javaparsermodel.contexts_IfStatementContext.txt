    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.IfStatementContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 7 methods (nom) and 121 lines of code (loc), which are moderate. It has no fields (nof, nopf), indicating it is likely a behavioral class with focused responsibilities. The weighted method complexity (wmc) of 24 is moderate, and the lack of fields suggests low internal complexity. The class extends a parent (dit=3) and uses dependencies for its specific context, showing appropriate decomposition. No metrics strongly indicate insufficient modularization."
