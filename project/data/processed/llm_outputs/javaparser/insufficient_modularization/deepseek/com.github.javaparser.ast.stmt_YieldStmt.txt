    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.YieldStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has low complexity (WMC=18, LOC=73, NOM=14) with no fields (NOF=1, NOPF=0) and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). All methods are public (NOPM=14), indicating focused responsibility. LCOM=0.71 suggests moderate cohesion, but overall metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity requiring further decomposition."
