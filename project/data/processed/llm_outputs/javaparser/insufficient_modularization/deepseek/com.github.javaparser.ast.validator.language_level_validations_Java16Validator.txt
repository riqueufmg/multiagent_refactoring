    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1) and 16 lines of code (loc=16), which indicates minimal implementation complexity. It has no fields (nof=0) and no dependencies, suggesting it is already a focused, single-responsibility unit. Further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
