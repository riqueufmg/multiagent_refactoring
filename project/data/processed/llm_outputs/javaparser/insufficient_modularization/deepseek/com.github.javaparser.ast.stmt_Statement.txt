    "justification": "High number of methods (nom=92, nopm=92) and lines of code (loc=264) indicate large size and complexity. High weighted method count (wmc=92) and number of children (nc=62) suggest the class aggregates many responsibilities, which could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
