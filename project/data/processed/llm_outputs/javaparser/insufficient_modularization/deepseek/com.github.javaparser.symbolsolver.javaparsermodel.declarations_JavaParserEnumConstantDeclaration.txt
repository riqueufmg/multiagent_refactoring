    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics: only 2 fields, 5 methods, 27 lines of code, and 5 weighted methods per class. LCOM of 0.0 indicates good cohesion, and it has no fan-in or fan-out dependencies. The class is already small and cohesive, showing no signs of insufficient modularization."
