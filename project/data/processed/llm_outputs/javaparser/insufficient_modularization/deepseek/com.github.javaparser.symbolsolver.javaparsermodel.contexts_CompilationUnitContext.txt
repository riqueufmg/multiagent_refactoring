    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.CompilationUnitContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High WMC (65) and LOC (241) indicate significant complexity. Moderate LCOM (0.4) suggests some cohesion issues. The class has 15 methods with only 5 being public, indicating many internal methods that could be extracted. The presence of 12 external dependencies suggests multiple responsibilities that could be separated."
