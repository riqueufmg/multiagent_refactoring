    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ParseStart",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1) and 29 lines of code (loc=29), which is small and simple. It has no fields (nof=22 indicates 22 fields but nopf=0 indicates no public fields, suggesting these are likely constants/enum values rather than instance fields). The low complexity (wmc=1) and minimal dependencies indicate sufficient modularization for its purpose."
