    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=23, LOC=89) and moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.625). It has a moderate number of methods (NOM=16) but no fields (NOF=2, NOPF=0) indicating it is primarily a data/expression node. The lack of internal state and dependencies suggests it is already well-modularized for its purpose."
