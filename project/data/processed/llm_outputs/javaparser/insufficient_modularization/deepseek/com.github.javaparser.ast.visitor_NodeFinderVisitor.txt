    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.NodeFinderVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 102 methods (nom=102) and 1868 lines of code (loc=1868), indicating excessive size and complexity. All 102 methods are public (nopm=102), suggesting the class handles many distinct responsibilities. The high weighted method count (wmc=648) and low cohesion (lcom=0.02) further indicate insufficient decomposition into smaller, more focused modules."
