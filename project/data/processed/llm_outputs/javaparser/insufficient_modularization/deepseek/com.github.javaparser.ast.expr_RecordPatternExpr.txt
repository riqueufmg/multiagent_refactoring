    "justification": "High method count (nom=18) and high weighted method complexity (wmc=32) indicate significant implementation complexity. Moderate lack of cohesion (lcom=0.61) suggests multiple responsibilities. The class has 0 fan-in and 0 fan-out, showing it is not reused and could be decomposed without affecting dependencies."
