    "justification": "Class has 15 methods (14 public) with 116 lines of code and 24 weighted methods per class, indicating high implementation complexity that could be reduced through decomposition. The lack of fields (nof=0) suggests it's a utility class with multiple responsibilities that could be split into smaller, more focused classes."
