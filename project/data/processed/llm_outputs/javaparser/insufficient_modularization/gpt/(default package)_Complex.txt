    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=21, NOM=5, WMC=5, only 2 fields (NOF=2) and low LCOM=0.4. There are no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate limited size and complexity and reasonable cohesion, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
