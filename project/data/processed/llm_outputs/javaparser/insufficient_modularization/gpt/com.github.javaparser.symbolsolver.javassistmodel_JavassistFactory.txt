    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has a small public surface and size (nom=3, nopm=2, loc=58) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although WMC=16 indicates some internal method complexity, the very low number of methods and a strongly negative LCOM (-1.0) indicate high cohesion and a focused responsibility. Given these metrics in isolation, there is insufficient evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or should be decomposed further."
