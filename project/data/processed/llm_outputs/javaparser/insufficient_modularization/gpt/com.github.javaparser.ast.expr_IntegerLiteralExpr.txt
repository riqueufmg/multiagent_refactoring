    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.IntegerLiteralExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of Insufficient Modularization: it has 15 methods (nom=15) in a relatively small body (loc=85) with only 2 fields (nof=2, nopf=2), and a very high LCOM (0.9333333333333332) indicating low cohesion — many methods likely do not operate on the same state. Combined complexity (wmc=19) and deep inheritance (dit=6, nc=2) increase implementation complexity. These metrics (high method count and complexity versus very few fields, plus high LCOM) justify decomposing the class to reduce size and complexity."
