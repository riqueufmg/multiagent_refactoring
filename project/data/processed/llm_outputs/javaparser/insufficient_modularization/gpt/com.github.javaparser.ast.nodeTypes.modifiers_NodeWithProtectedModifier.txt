    "detection": false,
    "justification": "False — evidence does not indicate insufficient modularization. The class is very small and simple (LOC=11, NOM=2), has low complexity (WMC=2), high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no dependencies. These metrics show a minimal, cohesive implementation that does not require further decomposition when considered in isolation."
