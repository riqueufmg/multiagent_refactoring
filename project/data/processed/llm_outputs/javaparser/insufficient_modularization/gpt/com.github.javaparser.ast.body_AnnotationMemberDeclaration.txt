    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.AnnotationMemberDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows symptoms of insufficient modularization: large size (loc=169) and high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=44) with many methods (nom=24). It has relatively few fields (nof=4) but many operations, which suggests behavior concentration rather than clean data encapsulation. Cohesion is not high (lcom=0.458), indicating multiple responsibilities. The dependency set is broad and heterogeneous (e.g. GenericVisitor, VoidVisitor, JavadocComment, Expression, Type, SimpleName, NodeList, TokenRange, ObservableProperty, ResolvedAnnotationMemberDeclaration, metamodel classes), implying the class handles concerns across parsing, metadata, visitors, documentation and expressions. The combination of size, complexity, moderate cohesion and diverse dependencies supports refactoring by decomposing the class into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
