    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=61), modest number of methods (nom=8), moderate complexity (wmc=11) with average complexity per method low, high cohesion (lcom=-1.0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and shallow inheritance (dit=1). These elements suggest the class is reasonably cohesive and not large/complex enough to require further decomposition."
