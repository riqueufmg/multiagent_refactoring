    "justification": "Class is minimal and shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: LOC=4, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, NC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0, and no dependencies. With no methods, fields, or complexity to decompose, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
