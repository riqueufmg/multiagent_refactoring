    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class concentrates complex behavior: 11 methods (nom=11) and a high weighted method count (wmc=20) within only 69 LOC (loc=69). It declares few fields (nof=3) but many methods, which often indicates behavior that could be split into smaller, focused classes. The inheritance depth (dit=4) adds to its implementation complexity. Cohesion is moderate (lcom=0.2727) — not high enough to rule out decomposition — and the class shows no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), lowering the risk of refactoring. Based on these elements, the class appears insufficiently modular and is a candidate for decomposition."
