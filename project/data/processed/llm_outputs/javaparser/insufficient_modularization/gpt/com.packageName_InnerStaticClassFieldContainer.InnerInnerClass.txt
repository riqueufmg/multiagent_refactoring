    "class": "com.packageName.InnerStaticClassFieldContainer.InnerInnerClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=6, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), a single field (nof=1, nopf=1), very low complexity (wmc=0), and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not present signs that it needs further decomposition (lcom=-1.0 is not indicative of poor cohesion here)."
