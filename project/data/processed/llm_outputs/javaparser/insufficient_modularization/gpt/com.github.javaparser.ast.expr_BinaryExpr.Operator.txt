    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: very small size (loc=24), no methods (nom=0) and only 1 field (nof=1), minimal complexity (wmc=0), low inheritance depth (dit=1), very low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, 1 dependency), and a non-problematic cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0). These metrics indicate the class is already simple and does not require further decomposition."
