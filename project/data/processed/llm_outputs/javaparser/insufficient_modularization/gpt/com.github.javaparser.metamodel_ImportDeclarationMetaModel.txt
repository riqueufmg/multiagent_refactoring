    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=12, WMC=1, NOM=1, LCOM=0.0. It has a small number of fields (nof=4) and no excessive public methods (nopm=0). Low fanin/fanout (0) and a single dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) indicate limited coupling. Depth of inheritance (DIT=2) is modest. These metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large, or complex class, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
