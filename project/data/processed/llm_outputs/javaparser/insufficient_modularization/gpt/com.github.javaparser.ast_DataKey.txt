    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=16, WMC=2, NOM=2, NOF=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, and no dependencies. These metrics indicate low size, low complexity and low coupling, so there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition. LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems."
