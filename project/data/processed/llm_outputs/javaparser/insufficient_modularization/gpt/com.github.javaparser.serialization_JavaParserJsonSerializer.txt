    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, oversized class: LOC=129 and NOM=6 show moderate size and small number of methods; WMC=14 is moderate complexity but not extreme; LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion (methods operate on related data). There is only 1 public method (NOPM=1), implying a small public surface. NOF=4 fields is modest. The listed dependencies include several internal Json* types (JsonRange, JsonNode, JsonToken, JsonTokenRange) suggesting internal decomposition is already present. Taken in isolation, these factors point away from Insufficient Modularization."
