    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=19, NOM=5 and WMC=5 indicate low size and low implementation complexity. There are no fields (NOF=0) and coupling is minimal (FANOUT=0, FANIN=0, only 1 listed dependency), so responsibilities are limited. LCOM=-1.0 suggests methods are cohesive. Although DIT=4 and NC=3 show inheritance depth and subclasses, the class itself is compact; there is no evidence from these metrics that it needs further decomposition."
