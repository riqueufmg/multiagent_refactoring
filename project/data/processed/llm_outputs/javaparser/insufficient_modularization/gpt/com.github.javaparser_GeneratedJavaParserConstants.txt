    "class": "com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParserConstants",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: nof=158 (very large number of fields), loc=637 (large size/implementation volume), nom=0 (no methods, indicating a monolithic constants/data holder rather than multiple cohesive components), wmc=0 and nc=2 (no evident internal behavioral decomposition). These metrics together indicate the class is large and not decomposed; it could be split into smaller, more focused modules."
