    "class": "extends_duplicate.A.DuplicateTypeName",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is minimal and shows no evidence of insufficient modularization: LOC=2, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOPM=0, NC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class has no methods/fields and negligible complexity; the large DIT (3250) and LCOM=-1.0 are anomalous but do not indicate internal size/complexity that would justify decomposition."
