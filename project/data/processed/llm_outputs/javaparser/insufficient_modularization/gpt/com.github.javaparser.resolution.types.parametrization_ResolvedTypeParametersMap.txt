    "justification": "Class size and cohesion do not indicate a need for further decomposition: LOC is small (84) and LCOM is low (0.1666) indicating good cohesion. Although there are 12 methods (nom=12) and 11 public methods (nopm=11), WMC is moderate (17) but not accompanied by large size or poor cohesion. No public fields (nopf=0) and limited external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) further reduce the rationale for splitting. Based on these metrics in isolation, insufficient modularization is not detected."
