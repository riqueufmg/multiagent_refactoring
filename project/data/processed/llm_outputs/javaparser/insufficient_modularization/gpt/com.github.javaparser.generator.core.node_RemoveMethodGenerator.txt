    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.node.RemoveMethodGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC = 60 and NOM = 5 indicate limited size and responsibility scope. Complexity is modest (WMC = 12) and there is only one public API method (NOPM = 1), implying helper/private methods are used internally rather than exposing multiple responsibilities. LCOM = -1.0 suggests good cohesion. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, showing the class is self-contained in the given data. Taken in isolation, these metrics do not support that the class is insufficiently modularized or that it requires further decomposition."
