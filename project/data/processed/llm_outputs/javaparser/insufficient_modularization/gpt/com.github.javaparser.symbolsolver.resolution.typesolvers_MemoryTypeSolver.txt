    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small (loc=48) with only 2 fields (nof=2) and 8 methods (nom=8) — method density is moderate. Cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.25), indicating related functionality rather than multiple unrelated responsibilities. Complexity is not extreme (wmc=14) given the method count, and there is no coupling signal (fanin=0, fanout=0) that would suggest hidden responsibilities spread across other modules. Based on these metrics taken in isolation, there is insufficient evidence that the class suffers from Insufficient Modularization."
