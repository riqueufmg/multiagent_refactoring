    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=5, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0, NOPM=1. It has no fields (NOF=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further; Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
