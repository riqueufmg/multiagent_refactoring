    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class contains a large number of methods (nom = 18, nopm = 18) and non-trivial implementation size (loc = 110) with high aggregated complexity (wmc = 29) which suggests multiple responsibilities that could be split; cohesion is moderate/low (lcom = 0.5556), indicating methods are not tightly focused on a single cohesive purpose; there are very few fields (nof = 2) relative to methods, implying many behaviors are implemented in one class rather than encapsulated in smaller modules; depth of inheritance (dit = 4) increases the likelihood of mixed responsibilities being placed in this class. These indicators together point to Insufficient Modularization and that further decomposition would likely reduce size and complexity."
