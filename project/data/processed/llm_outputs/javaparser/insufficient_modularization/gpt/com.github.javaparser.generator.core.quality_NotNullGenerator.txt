    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC is moderate (93), NOM is modest (8) with only 2 public methods (NOPM=2), WMC is 18 (some complexity but not extreme), and LCOM is -1.0 (indicating high cohesion). There are no fields (NOF=0) and no coupling indications in fanin/fanout. Overall the class appears focused and cohesive rather than a large, poorly decomposed unit."
