    "justification": "Metrics show a small, cohesive class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=15, number of methods=2, WMC=3 (low complexity), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). It has only 1 field and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the small size, low complexity, and high cohesion, further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
