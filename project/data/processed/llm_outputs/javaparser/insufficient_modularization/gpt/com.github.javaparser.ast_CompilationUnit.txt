    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.CompilationUnit",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a strong candidate for Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc = 615) and high implementation complexity (WMC = 100) combined with many methods (nom = 59, nopm = 55 public methods) indicate it likely bundles multiple responsibilities. It depends on a wide set of external types (≈26 distinct dependencies), increasing its surface and responsibilities. Although field count is moderate (nof = 9), the moderate cohesion metric (LCOM = 0.254) and depth of inheritance (DIT = 3) do not offset the high method/complexity/size indicators. These elements together justify that the class should be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
