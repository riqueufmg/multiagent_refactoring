    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=13, nom=1, wmc=1 indicate low size and low implementation complexity. LCOM=0.0 shows high cohesion. Field count (nof=5) is modest and nopf=5 alone does not indicate a need for decomposition. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no many public methods (nopm=0). The inheritance depth (dit=4) does not imply that this class is monolithic. Based on these metrics considered in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
