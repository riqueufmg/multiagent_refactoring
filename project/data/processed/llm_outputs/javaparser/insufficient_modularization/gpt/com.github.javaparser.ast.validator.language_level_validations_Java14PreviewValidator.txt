    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and not complex: LOC = 16, number of methods = 1, WMC = 1. It has no fields (nof = 0) and no public fields (nopf = 0), and shows no coupling to other code (fanin = 0, fanout = 0, dependencies = []). Cohesion does not indicate fragmentation (lcom = -1.0). While DIT is high (dit = 18), that alone does not indicate the class is insufficiently modularized; given the minimal size and complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
