    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: loc=1, nom=0, nof=0, nopm=0, wmc=0 indicate it is extremely small and contains no methods or fields; fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no coupling to decompose; lcom=-1.0 is not indicative of low cohesion here given the absence of members. Based on these metrics, further decomposition is not warranted."
