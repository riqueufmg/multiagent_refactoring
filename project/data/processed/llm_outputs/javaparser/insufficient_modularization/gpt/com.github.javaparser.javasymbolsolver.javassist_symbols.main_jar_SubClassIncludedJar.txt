    "class": "com.github.javaparser.javasymbolsolver.javassist_symbols.main_jar.SubClassIncludedJar",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=3), no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), a single field (nof=1), no inheritance depth (dit=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition."
