    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: relatively small size (LOC=100) and modest number of methods (nom=8) with only 2 fields (nof=2) and 3 public methods (nopm=3). LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion among methods, and the listed dependencies are all within the Javadoc/parsing domain (Javadoc, JavadocDescription, JavadocBlockTag, JavadocComment, utils), suggesting a single focused responsibility. Although WMC=22 shows some internal complexity, it is not paired with high size, low cohesion, or many fields that would strongly indicate a need to split the class. Therefore insufficient modularization is not detected."
