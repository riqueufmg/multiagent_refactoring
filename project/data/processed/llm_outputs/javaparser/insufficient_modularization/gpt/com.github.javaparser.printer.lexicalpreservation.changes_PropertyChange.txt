    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=28, nom=5, nof=3. Complexity is low (wmc=6) and cohesion is high (lcom=0.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance is shallow (dit=1, nc=0). Given the small size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition would meaningfully reduce size or complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
