    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large interface and complexity for a single class: nom=15 methods (nopm=14 public), loc=116, and WMC=24. These values indicate many responsibilities and non-trivial internal complexity. nc=0 (no fields) shows the class implements a collection of stateless behaviors rather than a cohesive single responsibility, and the high number of public methods suggests it can be decomposed into smaller, focused classes or modules. lcom=-1.0 (cohesion metric abnormal/low), together with the method and complexity counts, supports the detection of Insufficient Modularization."
