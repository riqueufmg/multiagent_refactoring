    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionAnnotationDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom = 22, nopm = 22) and a non-trivial cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc = 30) for its size (loc = 118), which indicates concentrated implementation responsibility that could be split; all methods being public (nopm = nom) suggests multiple externally visible responsibilities and an opportunity to move subsets of functionality into smaller, focused classes; the class depends on multiple distinct concerns (ReflectionClassAdapter, ReflectionFactory, ReflectionMethodResolutionLogic, TypeSolver, InferenceContext, MethodUsage, ResolvedType, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, Context, SymbolReference) suggesting mixing of roles (adapter/factory/resolution/declaration) that supports decomposition; cohesion is only moderate (lcom = 0.318) rather than very high, so related behavior could be grouped into separate modules; the relatively deep inheritance (dit = 5) increases conceptual complexity and strengthens the case for extracting responsibilities. Based on these metrics and dependencies taken in isolation, the class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization and would likely benefit from decomposition."
