    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=23, NOM=5, NOF=1 indicate limited size; WMC=8 shows only moderate complexity; DIT=1 and fanin=0/fanout=0 indicate low coupling; although LCOM=0.6 suggests only moderate cohesion, given the small size and modest complexity there is insufficient evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
