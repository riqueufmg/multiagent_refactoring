    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedMethodLikeDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it defines 15 methods (nom = 15) within 114 LOC, and has a high weighted method count (WMC = 25), indicating concentrated complexity and multiple responsibilities that could be split. The depth of inheritance (DIT = 2) and number of children (NC = 2) are low, so responsibilities are not being delegated to subclasses. Fanin and fanout are 0, suggesting the class is largely self-contained rather than collaborating to distribute behavior. These elements together (high method count, high complexity, low distribution via inheritance or coupling) justify flagging insufficient modularization."
