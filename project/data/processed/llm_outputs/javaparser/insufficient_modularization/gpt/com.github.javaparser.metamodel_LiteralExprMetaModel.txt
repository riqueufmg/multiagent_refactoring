    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: loc=11, NOM=2, WMC=2. It has no fields (NOF=0) and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no external dependencies. Cohesion metric (LCOM=-1.0) does not indicate fragmentation. DIT=3 alone is not sufficient to justify further decomposition. Given the minimal size, low complexity, and lack of coupling, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
