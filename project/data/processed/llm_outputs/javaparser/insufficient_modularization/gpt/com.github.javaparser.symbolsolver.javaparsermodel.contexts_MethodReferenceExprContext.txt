    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.MethodReferenceExprContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has few methods (nom = 4, nopm = 2) but a high implementation complexity and size (loc = 120, WMC = 29). This yields an average complexity and size per method that is large (≈30 LOC and ≈7.25 WMC per method), which is a common sign that responsibilities are not decomposed. The class also depends on a wide variety of distinct concerns (e.g. FunctionalInterfaceLogic, MethodReferenceExpr, MethodCallExpr, TypeSolver, ObjectCreationExpr, ReturnStmt, Navigator, InferenceContext, JavaParserFacade, VariableDeclarator, ResolvedLambdaConstraintType, SymbolReference, ResolvedType, ResolvedConstructorDeclaration, ResolvedMethodDeclaration, MethodResolutionLogic, MethodUsage), indicating it handles multiple roles. Taken in isolation, the combination of low method count, high complexity/size, and many diverse dependencies justifies flagging Insufficient Modularization."
