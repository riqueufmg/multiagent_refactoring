    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it declares 14 methods (nom=14, nopm=14) but only 1 field (nof=1), has moderate size (loc=69) and complexity (wmc=18) while exhibiting low cohesion (lcom=0.714). The combination of many public methods with minimal shared state indicates multiple responsibilities or behaviors that could be split into smaller, more focused classes or helpers to reduce complexity and improve cohesion."
