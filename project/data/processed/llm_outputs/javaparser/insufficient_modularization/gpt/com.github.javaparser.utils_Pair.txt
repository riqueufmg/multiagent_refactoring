    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.Pair",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=28, NOM=4, NOF=2, NOPF=2. Low complexity and limited responsibility: WMC=8, LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). Low coupling and interaction: FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, DEPENDENCIES=[]. DIT=0 and NC=0 indicate no inheritance-related complexity. Given its small size, low complexity, high cohesion, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
