    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.bounds.SameAsBound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and reasonably cohesive: LOC=57, NOM=10, WMC=16 and LCOM=0.2. It has only 2 fields (NOF=2) and a shallow inheritance depth (DIT=1). There is no indication of high coupling in the provided metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the modest size, moderate complexity and low cohesion value (indicating cohesion rather than dispersion of responsibilities), there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
