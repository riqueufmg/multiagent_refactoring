    "justification": "Class is small and reasonably cohesive: LOC=69, NOM=5 (NOPM=4), NOF=0. Cohesion appears good (LCOM=-1.0). Cyclomatic/implementation complexity is moderate (WMC=18) but not accompanied by many methods or fields that would indicate a large undecomposed class. Coupling indicators are low (fanin=0, fanout=0). Based on these metrics in isolation there is insufficient evidence that the class has not been decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
