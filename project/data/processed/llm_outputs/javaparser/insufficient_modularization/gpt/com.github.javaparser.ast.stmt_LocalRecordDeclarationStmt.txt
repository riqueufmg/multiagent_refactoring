    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate potential Insufficient Modularization: 14 methods (nom=14) and a weighted method count of 18 (wmc=18) in a 70-line class (loc=70) suggest significant implementation packed into a single class. Low cohesion is evident (lcom=0.714), implying the methods do not form a tightly related set of responsibilities and may represent multiple concerns that could be split. There is only one field (nof=1) while many methods exist, which often indicates behavior that could be delegated to new classes. A relatively deep inheritance depth (dit=4) increases the class's conceptual complexity and can hide multiple responsibilities. The dependency list (visitors, metamodel, RecordDeclaration, Node, TokenRange, ObservableProperty) shows the class touches several distinct areas (AST node structure, visitor dispatch, metamodel/observable concerns), reinforcing the indication that responsibilities might be separable. Together, these factors justify flagging the class for further decomposition."
