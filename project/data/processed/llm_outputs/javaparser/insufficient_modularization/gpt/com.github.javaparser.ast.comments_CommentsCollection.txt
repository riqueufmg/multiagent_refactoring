    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC = 53, number of methods = 11, number of fields = 1. LCOM = 0.1818 indicates high cohesion. Coupling is low (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and dependencies are limited to comment/Range types. Although WMC = 15 shows moderate internal complexity, the overall size and high cohesion do not indicate an undecomposed, multi-responsibility class that would benefit from further modularization."
