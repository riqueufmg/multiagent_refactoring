    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a clear Insufficient Modularization smell. Although the class has 21 methods (nom = 21) and a moderate complexity (wmc = 31), its size is modest (loc = 126) and it has few fields (nof = 3), which suggests methods operate on a small, focused state. Cohesion is acceptable (lcom = 0.476), implying methods are related rather than representing multiple unrelated responsibilities. Fan-in and fan-out are zero in the provided data, so there is no evidence of tangled external dependencies that would require splitting. Given these values considered in isolation, there is insufficient evidence to recommend further decomposition."
