    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=12, WMC=1, NOM=1. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Number of fields (NOF=4) is modest and does not coincide with high complexity or many responsibilities. Although DIT=4, the class size and low complexity indicate it does not require further decomposition."
