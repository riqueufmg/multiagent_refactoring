    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small (LOC=51) with a modest method count (NOM=13) and moderate complexity (WMC=13). Cohesion is reasonably high (LCOM=0.3077), it has few fields (NOF=3) and few external dependencies. Although it has many public methods (NOPM=11), the overall size and cohesion do not indicate an incomplete decomposition that would benefit from further modularization."
