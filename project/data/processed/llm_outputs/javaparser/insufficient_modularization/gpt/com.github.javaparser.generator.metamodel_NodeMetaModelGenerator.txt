    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large class. LOC = 75 and NOM = 4 show modest size and few methods; NOF = 4 fields is small. WMC = 12 is moderate (average complexity ≈3 per method) but not extreme. LCOM = 0.5 indicates neither very low nor very high cohesion — no clear sign of multiple unrelated responsibilities. Fanin = 0 and Fanout = 0 show no heavy coupling that would suggest hidden responsibilities. Overall the class size and complexity do not justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
