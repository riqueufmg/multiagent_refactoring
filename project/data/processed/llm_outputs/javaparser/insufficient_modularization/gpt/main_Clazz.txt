    "justification": "The class is very small and contains no decomposable implementation: LOC=3, NOM=0 (no methods), WMC=0 (no complexity), NOF=0 and NOPF=0 (no fields), Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 (no couplings). These metrics indicate there is nothing within the class to further decompose, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
