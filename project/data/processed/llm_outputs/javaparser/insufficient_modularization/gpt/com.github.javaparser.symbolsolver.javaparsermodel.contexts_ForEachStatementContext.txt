    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=27), few methods (nom=4, nopm=4), no fields (nof=0), moderate cyclomatic/weight (wmc=8) and high cohesion (lcom=-1.0). Low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no excessive responsibilities are visible in isolation. Although DIT=3, the class itself is compact and does not show evidence that it should be further decomposed."
