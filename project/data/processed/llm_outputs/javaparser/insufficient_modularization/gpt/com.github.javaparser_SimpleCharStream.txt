    "justification": "False — The class is small and sufficiently decomposed: LOC = 50, NOM = 8 and WMC = 8 indicate limited size and complexity; LCOM = 0.375 shows reasonable cohesion; NOF = 1 (few fields) and NOPF = 0; fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 indicate low coupling; dependencies list contains only one external type (com.github.javaparser.Provider). These metrics do not suggest that further decomposition is needed."
