    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization. It is small (loc=29) with a modest number of methods (nom=7) and low complexity (wmc=7). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0), there are only 2 fields (nof=2) and no public fields (nopf=0), and coupling appears low (fanout=0, fanin=0). Although the inheritance depth is nonzero (dit=4), the class size, complexity, and cohesion metrics indicate it is adequately decomposed and does not require further modularization."
