    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=10, NOM=3, WMC=3, NOF=0. It has no fields (NOF=0), minimal methods (NOM=3), low cyclomatic/implementation complexity (WMC=3), and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependency list contains a single type (Expression). These characteristics do not indicate an incompletely decomposed or overly large class, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
