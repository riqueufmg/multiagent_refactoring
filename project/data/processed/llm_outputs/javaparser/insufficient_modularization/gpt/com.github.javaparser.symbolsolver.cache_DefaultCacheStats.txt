    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs that further decomposition could reduce size/complexity: LOC = 136 (relatively large for a single class), NOM = 19 and NOPM = 19 (many methods, all publicly exposed, indicating multiple responsibilities or an overly large API surface), and WMC = 20 (moderate-to-high implementation complexity). Although LCOM = 0.0 indicates good internal cohesion, the combination of high method count, all-public methods, and non-trivial complexity suggests the class could be split into smaller, focused classes or helpers to improve modularity and reduce individual class complexity."
