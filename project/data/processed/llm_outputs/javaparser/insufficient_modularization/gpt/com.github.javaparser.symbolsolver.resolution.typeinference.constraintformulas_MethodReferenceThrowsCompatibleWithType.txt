    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and focused: LOC=26, NOM=4, WMC=7 and only 2 fields. Cohesion is acceptable (LCOM=0.5) and inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=1). Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is not overly large or complex and does not require further decomposition."
