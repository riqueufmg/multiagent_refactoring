    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=13, NOM=2, WMC=2. Low coupling and interaction: fanin=0, fanout=0, only 3 external type dependencies. No evidence of high implementation complexity or size that would benefit from further decomposition. Given these metrics in isolation, Insufficient Modularization is not indicated."
