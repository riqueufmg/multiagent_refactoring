    "justification": "Not detected: the class is very small and shows no signs of insufficient modularization — LOC=3, NOM=0 (no methods), WMC=0 (no complexity), NOF=1 (single field), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), dependencies=[]. LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems in this context. There is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
