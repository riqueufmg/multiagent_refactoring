    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.TextElementMatcher",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: 11 LOC, 2 methods (nom=2), low complexity (wmc=2), no fields (nof=0) and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Cohesion measure indicates no decomposition need (lcom=-1.0). Given these metrics taken in isolation, the class is already sufficiently modular and does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
