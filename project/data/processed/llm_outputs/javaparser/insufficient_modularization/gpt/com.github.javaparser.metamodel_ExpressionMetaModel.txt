    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=11, NOM=2, WMC=2. High cohesion indicated by LCOM=-1.0. No internal or external coupling pressure (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). Given the low size, low complexity and cohesive metrics, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed (DIT=2 and NC=25 do not by themselves imply insufficient modularization)."
