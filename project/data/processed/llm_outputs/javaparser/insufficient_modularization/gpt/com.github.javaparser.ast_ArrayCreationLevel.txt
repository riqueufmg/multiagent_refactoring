    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: 16 methods (nom=16) at only 111 LOC, high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=30), and only 2 fields (nof=2) — a high method-to-field ratio suggesting many behaviors concentrated in one class. DIT=3 and the class's numerous external dependencies (multiple metamodel, visitor and AST types) further imply varied responsibilities. Although cohesion is moderate (lcom=0.375), the combination of high WMC and many methods supports that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
