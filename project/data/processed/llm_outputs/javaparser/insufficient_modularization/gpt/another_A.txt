    "justification": "Class another.A has only 2 LOC and contains no fields (nof=0) and no methods (nom=0), with WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0 and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is minimal and not large or complex enough to warrant further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
