    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=9, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0, NOPF=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. With a single method, minimal complexity and no fields or external dependencies, there is no indication that the class has not been decomposed further; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
