    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.ConditionalExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a high number of methods (nom = 19) and a relatively high weighted methods complexity (wmc = 29) for a single class, with moderate size (loc = 112). Cohesion is middling (lcom = 0.5789473684210527) indicating the methods are not tightly focused on a single responsibility. There are few fields (nof = 3) but many methods, which often indicates multiple responsibilities implemented in one type. The class depends on diverse concerns (visitor APIs, metamodel, Range/TokenRange, ObservableProperty — e.g. com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.VoidVisitor, com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ConditionalExprMetaModel, com.github.javaparser.Range, com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.ObservableProperty), suggesting it mixes AST data holding, visitor logic, metamodel interaction and observation behavior. The inheritance depth (dit = 4) increases complexity carried by the class. Taken in isolation, these metrics and dependencies support that further decomposition (separating visitor/observation/metamodel concerns or extracting subcomponents) could reduce size and implementation complexity."
