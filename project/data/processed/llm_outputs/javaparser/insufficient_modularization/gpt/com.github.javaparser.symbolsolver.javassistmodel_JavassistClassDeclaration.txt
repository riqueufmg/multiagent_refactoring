    "justification": "High method count (nom = 39, nopm = 35 public methods) and substantial implementation size (loc = 182) combined with high complexity (wmc = 56) indicate the class contains a large amount of behavior that could be split. Deep inheritance (dit = 6) and a broad list of external dependencies (multiple referenced types) suggest multiple responsibilities or concerns are being handled. Although LCOM is low (0.1538) showing cohesion, the absolute number of methods and high WMC mean further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity; therefore Insufficient Modularization is detected."
