    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC = 58 (small), WMC = 13 (moderate complexity), NOM = 11 (reasonable method count), LCOM = -1.0 (indicates good cohesion), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (low coupling). Dependencies are limited. Together these show the class is not overly large, not highly complex, and is cohesive, so further decomposition is not indicated."
