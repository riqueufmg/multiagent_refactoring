    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.InferenceVariable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small (LOC=59) with few fields (NOF=3) and a moderate number of methods (NOM=11). Cohesion is reasonable (LCOM=0.3636), coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0), and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). Although WMC=17 indicates some internal complexity, given the small size and moderate cohesion there is insufficient evidence that the class has not been decomposed or that further decomposition would reduce size/complexity."
