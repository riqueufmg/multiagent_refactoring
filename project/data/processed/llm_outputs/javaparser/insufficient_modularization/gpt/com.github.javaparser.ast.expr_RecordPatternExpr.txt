    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.RecordPatternExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a high number of methods (nom = 18, nopm = 18) and a relatively high cyclomatic/weighted complexity (wmc = 32) for a single class, a moderate LOC (119) indicating substantial implementation, and low cohesion (lcom = 0.611) which suggests the methods are not tightly related. It also exposes many public methods (nopm = 18) while having few fields (nof = 2), implying the class may be carrying multiple responsibilities rather than encapsulating a focused state. The deep inheritance (dit = 6) increases conceptual complexity. Taken together these metrics indicate the class could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
