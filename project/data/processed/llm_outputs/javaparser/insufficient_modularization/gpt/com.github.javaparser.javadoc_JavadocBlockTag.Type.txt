    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=19, number of fields=1, number of methods=0, WMC=0. Low size and zero method complexity indicate no need for further decomposition. Low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no operational content (nom=0) argue against Insufficient Modularization. LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion metrics not applicable for a class without methods."
