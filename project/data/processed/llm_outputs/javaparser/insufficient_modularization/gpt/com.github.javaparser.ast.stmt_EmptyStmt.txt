    "justification": "Metrics indicate a small, low-complexity class: loc=40, nom=10, wmc=10 (average complexity ≈1 per method). It has no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate low cohesion, and the dependencies (visitor interfaces, TokenRange/Range, metamodel classes) are typical for an AST node. Although DIT=4 shows inheritance depth, there is no evidence of excessive size, high complexity, or low cohesion that would warrant further decomposition."
