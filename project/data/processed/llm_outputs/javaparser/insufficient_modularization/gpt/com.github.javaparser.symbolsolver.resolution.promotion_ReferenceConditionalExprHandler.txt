    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization not detected: the class is small and cohesive (LOC=17, nom=2, nopm=2, LCOM=0.0), has low complexity (WMC=4), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a couple of dependencies. These metrics indicate the class does not need further decomposition."
