    "justification": "The class is minimal and contains no internal implementation to decompose: loc=5, nom=0 (no methods), nof=0 (no fields), wmc=0 (no complexity). fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate no coupling to decompose. Although DIT=12 shows deep inheritance, in isolation the class has no members or behavior to be further modularized, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
