    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.SwitchNode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of Insufficient Modularization. Evidence: LOC=20 (small overall size); NOM=10 with WMC=10 (average complexity per method ≈1.0, indicating many small/simple methods rather than a few large complex ones); LCOM=-1.0 (indicates high cohesion); fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling to/from other classes); DIT=0 and NC=2 (no deep inheritance/large hierarchy). Dependencies are limited to a few AST node types. Taken in isolation these metrics indicate the class is small, cohesive, and not overly complex, so no further decomposition is warranted."
