    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a high number of methods (nom = 16) while maintaining very few fields (nof = 2), indicating many behaviors per unit of state. Its implementation complexity is elevated (wmc = 21) for a relatively small file (loc = 82). Cohesion is moderate/low (lcom = 0.625), suggesting methods are not tightly related and could be grouped into smaller, more focused classes. Depth of inheritance (dit = 4) increases conceptual complexity. The class has no nested classes (nc = 0) that might encapsulate responsibilities, and it depends on a variety of concepts (visitors, comments, statements, tokens, observers, metamodel types) which implies multiple responsibilities that could be separated. These metrics together justify that further decomposition could reduce size and complexity."
