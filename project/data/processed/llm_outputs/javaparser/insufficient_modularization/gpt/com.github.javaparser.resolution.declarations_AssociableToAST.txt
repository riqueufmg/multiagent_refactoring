    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=21), low complexity (WMC=2), few methods (NOM=2), no fields (NOF=0) and high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). No incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These values show the class is small, simple and cohesive, so there is no evidence it requires further decomposition."
