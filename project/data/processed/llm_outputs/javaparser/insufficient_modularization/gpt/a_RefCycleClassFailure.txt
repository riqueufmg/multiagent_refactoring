    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, simple class: LOC=5, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0, NOFM=1, DIT=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. Low size (5 lines), single method and minimal complexity (WMC=1) provide no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition. LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion issues reported) and absence of fields/dependencies further support that refactoring into smaller classes is unnecessary."
