    "justification": "Class is small and focused: LOC=48, NOM=2, NOPM=1, NOF=0. Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0) and there are no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating a single, well-scoped responsibility. Although WMC=10 shows some method complexity, that complexity is concentrated in only two methods rather than indicating a large, undecomposed class. Given the low size and high cohesion, there is no strong evidence of insufficient modularization."
