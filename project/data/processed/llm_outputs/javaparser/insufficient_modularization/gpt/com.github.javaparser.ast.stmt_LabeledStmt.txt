    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high number of methods (nom = 17) and relatively high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc = 24) within a modest size (loc = 92) indicate concentrated responsibilities. Cohesion is moderate/low (lcom = 0.588), suggesting methods are not tightly related and could be split into separate concerns. There are few fields (nof = 2, nopf = 0) supporting many methods, which often indicates multiple responsibilities implemented as methods rather than distinct collaborating classes. The inheritance depth (dit = 4) may further increase class responsibility. Taken together (nom, wmc, lcom, loc, nof), these elements justify refactoring/decomposition."
