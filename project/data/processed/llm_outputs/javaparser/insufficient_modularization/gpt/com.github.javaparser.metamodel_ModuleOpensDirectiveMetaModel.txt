    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=10), low complexity (wmc=1), very few methods and fields (nom=1, nof=2, nopf=2), high cohesion (lcom=0.0), and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). The moderate inheritance depth (dit=3) alone does not indicate this class is insufficiently decomposed."
