    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=20, NOM=2, WMC=4 indicate low size and complexity. LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show low coupling; dependencies are limited. Given these metrics, there is no evidence the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
