    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: loc=37 and nom=6 show limited size and responsibilities; wmc=8 indicates only moderate complexity; lcom=-1.0 implies high cohesion; nopm=1 shows a small public surface. Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0, dit=1). Given these values, there is no evidence the class is unduly large or doing multiple independent jobs that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
