    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.LineComment",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=13, nopm=13 — all methods are public) while being small in size (loc=49) and with a weighted method count equal to the number of methods (wmc=13), indicating many distinct responsibilities packed into one type. The deep inheritance level (dit=4) increases its behavioral surface and combined with the cohesion indicator (lcom=-1.0) suggests low/unclear cohesion. Its dependencies (visitor interfaces, Range/TokenRange, metamodel types) indicate it handles multiple concerns (AST content, visitor dispatching, token/range and metamodel exposure). Taken in isolation, these facts point to insufficient modularization: the class would likely benefit from decomposing distinct responsibilities (visitor handling, token/range/meta exposure, core comment data) into smaller, more focused units."
