    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected based on the following indicators of insufficient modularization: high weighted methods complexity (WMC = 20) relative to small size (LOC = 74) indicating concentrated complex logic; low cohesion (LCOM = 0.857) showing methods are not well-related and likely represent multiple responsibilities; multiple methods (nom = 7, nopm = 6) suggesting several public operations that could be split; only one field (nof = 1) while behavior is spread across many methods, a sign of procedural grouping rather than cohesive object structure; and numerous external dependencies (FieldAccessExpr, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, TypeSolver, Navigator, JavaParserFacade, ResolvedReferenceType, SymbolReference, ResolvedType, ResolvedEnumDeclaration, Expression, ResolvedPrimitiveType, JavaParserFactory) implying the class handles diverse concerns. The combination of high complexity, low cohesion, multiple public methods, and many dependencies supports that further decomposition would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
