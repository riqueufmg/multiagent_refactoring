    "justification": "The class shows no strong signs of Insufficient Modularization: LOC is small (66), number of methods is moderate (nom=11, nopm=10) and WMC is not excessive (18). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and it has only one field (nof=1), indicating related responsibilities are kept together. Coupling indicators show no heavy external entanglement (fanin=0, fanout=0, only 3 listed dependencies). These metrics collectively do not justify further decomposition in isolation."
