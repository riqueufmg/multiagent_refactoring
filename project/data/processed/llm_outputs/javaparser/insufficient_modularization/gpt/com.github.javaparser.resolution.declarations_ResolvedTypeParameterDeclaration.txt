    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows characteristics of insufficient modularization: high method count (nom = 33) and large size (loc = 230) indicating many responsibilities; high complexity (wmc = 41) suggesting complex internal logic; a large number of non-public/internal methods (nom - nopm = 22) which often signals multiple internal concerns that can be extracted; small number of fields (nof = 2) paired with many methods (high methods-to-fields ratio) implying behavior is not well grouped by state and may be split into helper/delegation classes; depth of inheritance (dit = 3) combined with the above increases maintenance complexity. These elements together justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
