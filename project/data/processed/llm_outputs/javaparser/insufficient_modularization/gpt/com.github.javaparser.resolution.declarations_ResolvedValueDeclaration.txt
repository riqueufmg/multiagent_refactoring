    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and low-complexity: LOC=10, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has a single external dependency (com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType). Cohesion appears high (LCOM=-1.0). There is no evidence of large size, high complexity, or multiple responsibilities that would justify further decomposition."
