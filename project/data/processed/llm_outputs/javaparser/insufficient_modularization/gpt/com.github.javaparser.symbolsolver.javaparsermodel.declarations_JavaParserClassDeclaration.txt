    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows characteristics of insufficient modularization: very high number of methods (nom = 44, public methods nopm = 41) and large implementation size (loc = 271) indicating many responsibilities; high complexity (wmc = 76) implying the class contains complex behavior that could be split; very few fields (nof = 3) while providing many operations, suggesting procedural/utility-like growth rather than cohesive stateful design; non-trivial inheritance depth (dit = 6) increasing conceptual complexity; and many external dependencies (~20 listed) which often indicates multiple responsibilities interacting with different concerns. Although LCOM = 0.227 suggests some cohesion, the combination of high method count, high complexity, large size, and few fields supports that further decomposition would likely reduce size and complexity."
