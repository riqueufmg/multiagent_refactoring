    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High implementation size and complexity indicates insufficient modularization: LOC = 136 and WMC = 32 show the class is relatively large and contains highly complex methods. Relatively small number of methods (NOM = 7, NOPM = 5) together with high WMC implies individual methods are large/complex and likely contain multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed. NOF = 0 (no fields) suggests behavior is concentrated in methods rather than captured in smaller cooperating objects, reinforcing the need to split responsibilities. DIT = 3 indicates some inheritance depth but does not explain the internal complexity. These metrics together justify that the class should be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
