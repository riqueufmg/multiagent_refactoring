    "justification": "Class is tiny and already minimal: LOC=5, NOM=1, NOPM=1, NOF=0, WMC=1. Cohesion metric LCOM=-1.0 (no indication of multiple unrelated responsibilities). No incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the single method, lack of fields, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence this class needs further decomposition."
