    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.modules.ModuleRequiresDirective",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a high number of methods (nom=24) with all methods public (nopm=24) while containing very few fields (nof=2), indicating lots of behavior not tightly bound to internal state. Its weighted methods complexity is high (wmc=35) for a relatively small file (loc=123), and cohesion is low (lcom=0.7083), which suggests multiple responsibilities. The dependency list (visitor types, metamodel, token range, name, observable property) indicates the class handles varied concerns (visiting, metadata, token/name handling). Taken in isolation, these metrics imply the class could be further decomposed to reduce complexity and improve cohesion."
