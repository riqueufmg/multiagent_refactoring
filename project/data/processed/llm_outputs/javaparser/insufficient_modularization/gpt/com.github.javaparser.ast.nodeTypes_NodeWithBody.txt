    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=16, NOM=4, WMC=4 indicating low complexity; LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion). Low coupling and limited dependencies: fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies only [BlockStmt, Statement]. No indication of excessive size or responsibility (NC=8 does not outweigh small size/complexity). Therefore there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
