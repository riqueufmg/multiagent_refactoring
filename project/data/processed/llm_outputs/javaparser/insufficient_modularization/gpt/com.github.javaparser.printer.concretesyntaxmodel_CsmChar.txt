    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmChar",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (17 LOC), has few members (1 field, 4 methods), low complexity (WMC=4), high cohesion (LCOM=0.0), low coupling (fanout=0, fanin=0), shallow inheritance (DIT=1), and only a small set of dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already small and well-focused, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
