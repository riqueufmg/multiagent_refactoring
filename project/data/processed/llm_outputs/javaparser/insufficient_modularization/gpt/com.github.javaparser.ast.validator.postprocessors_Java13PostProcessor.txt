    "justification": "Class is very small and contains no decomposable elements: LOC=5, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0. It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no methods or fields to split. Although DIT=4, the class itself has no content or complexity to justify further decomposition, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
