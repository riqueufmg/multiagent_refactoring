    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistInterfaceDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: although the class has a relatively high number of methods (nom=28, nopm=26) and moderate cyclomatic weight (wmc=42), other indicators do not support insufficient modularization. The class is small in size (loc=141), has few fields (nof=3, nopf=0), and shows high cohesion (lcom=0.107), implying methods are closely related. Coupling indicators are low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is no evidence here of unrelated responsibilities that would benefit from decomposition. Therefore, based on the provided metrics in isolation, the class does not exhibit clear signs of insufficient modularization."
