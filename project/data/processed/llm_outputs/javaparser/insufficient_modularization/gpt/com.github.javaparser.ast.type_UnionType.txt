    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.UnionType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: 19 methods (nom=19) implemented in a relatively small file (loc=95) with high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=27). Cohesion is low (lcom=0.631578947368421) while it exposes only 1 field (nof=1), indicating many methods operate across few shared state elements (multiple responsibilities rather than a single cohesive role). The class also has a deep inheritance level (dit=4) and depends on many external types (listed dependencies), suggesting it aggregates varied functionality. These factors (high method count and complexity, low cohesion, few fields, multiple external dependencies) together justify that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
