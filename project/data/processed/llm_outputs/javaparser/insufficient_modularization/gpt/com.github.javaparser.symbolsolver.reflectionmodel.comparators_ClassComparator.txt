    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has only 1 method (nom=1) and is very small (loc=19). Cyclomatic/weight metric is modest (wmc=6) and there are no external couplings (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion problem in this isolated view (likely no fields). Given the single-method, low-size nature, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
