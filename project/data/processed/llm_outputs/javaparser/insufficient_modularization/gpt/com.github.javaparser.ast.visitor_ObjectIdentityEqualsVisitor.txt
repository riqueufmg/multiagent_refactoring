    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.ObjectIdentityEqualsVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a very large public interface and implementation surface (nom = 104, nopm = 104) and high overall complexity/size (LOC = 319, WMC = 104). It depends on a long list of distinct AST node types (many visit targets in the provided dependencies), which indicates it likely implements many visit methods and mixes responsibilities for many node kinds. The cohesion metric (LCOM = 1.0) together with these size/complexity values suggests the class is not sufficiently decomposed. These factors justify refactoring into smaller, focused modules/visitors or extracting helper classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
