    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=9, WMC=1, 1 field (nof=1) and 1 method (nom=1). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on PropertyMetaModel). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Although DIT=3, the class itself shows low size and complexity, so there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
