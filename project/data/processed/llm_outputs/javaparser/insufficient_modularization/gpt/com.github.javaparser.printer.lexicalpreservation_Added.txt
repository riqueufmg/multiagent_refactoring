    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.Added",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large public API and complexity for its size (nom=14, nopm=12, loc=54, wmc=18) combined with low cohesion (lcom=0.2857142857142857). There is only one field (nof=1) and no nested classes (nc=0) while exposing many methods, which suggests multiple responsibilities are implemented in a single class. These indicators (high method count and WMC relative to small LOC, many public methods, and low cohesion) justify that the class is insufficiently modularized.
