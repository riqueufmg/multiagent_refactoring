    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has only one method (nom=1) but holds multiple fields (nof=5) and shows relatively high complexity (wmc=7) within a small file (loc=38). These metrics indicate that substantial behavior is concentrated in a single routine rather than decomposed across methods or collaborating classes. Although cohesion is high (lcom=0.0), the single-method design with elevated complexity suggests the class could be further decomposed to reduce implementation complexity and improve modularization. fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate it is isolated, so internal decomposition would be the appropriate refactoring target."
