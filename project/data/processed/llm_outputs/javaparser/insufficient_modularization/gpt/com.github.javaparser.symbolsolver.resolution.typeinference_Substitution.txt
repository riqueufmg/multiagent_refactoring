    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and reasonably cohesive: LOC=30, NOM=4 (NOPM=3 public methods), NOF=3 fields, WMC=5 indicating low implementation complexity. LCOM=0.5 shows acceptable cohesion and DIT=0 indicates no inheritance complexity. Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 show no coupling pressure. Given the low size, low complexity, moderate cohesion and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition (Insufficient Modularization = false)."
