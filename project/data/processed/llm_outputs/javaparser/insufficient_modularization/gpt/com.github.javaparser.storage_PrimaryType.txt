    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=2), no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no inheritance depth (dit=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no dependencies. Insufficient Modularization requires a large/complex class that can be further decomposed, which is not supported by these metrics."
