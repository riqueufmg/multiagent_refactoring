    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: loc=70 (small class size), nom=13 (moderate method count), wmc=21 (moderate complexity), lcom=-1.0 (high cohesion). Additionally fanin=0 and fanout=0 show low external coupling. Together these metrics suggest the class is cohesive and not overly large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
