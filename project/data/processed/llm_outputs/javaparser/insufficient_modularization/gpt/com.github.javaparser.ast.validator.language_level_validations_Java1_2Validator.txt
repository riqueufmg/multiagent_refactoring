    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=12, WMC=1, NOM=1 (NOPM=1). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and there is no coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the single method and low complexity, there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed or that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
