    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=13, NOM=1, NOF=1, NOPM=1 and WMC=1 indicate a single, low-complexity responsibility. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and there are no incoming or outgoing coupling concerns (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although the inheritance depth (DIT=14) is deep, the class itself is not large or complex and does not show signs that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity. Therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
