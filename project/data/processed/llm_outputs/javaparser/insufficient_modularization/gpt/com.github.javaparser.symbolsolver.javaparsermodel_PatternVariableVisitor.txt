    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: loc=84 and nom=8 indicate limited size and number of responsibilities. Complexity is moderate (wmc=16) but spread across only 8 methods (avg complexity ~2), and LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. There are no fields (nof=0) to suggest multiple independent stateful concerns, and dependencies are focused on closely related AST expression types and PatternVariableResult. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no strong evidence that the class has not been decomposed or would benefit from further modularization."
