    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistAnnotationDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit clear signs of Insufficient Modularization: it has a small size (LOC=80) and few fields (NOF=3), good cohesion (LCOM=0.3889 < 0.5), and limited external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although it has 18 methods (NOM=18) and a moderate cyclomatic weight (WMC=20), these do not by themselves indicate an undivided set of responsibilities given the low LOC and high cohesion. The deep inheritance (DIT=5) and listed dependencies do not provide evidence, in isolation, that the class should be further decomposed."
