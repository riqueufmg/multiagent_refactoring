    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=14, nom=2 (nopm=2) and nof=0. Complexity is low (WMC=3). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are limited. LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Given its small size, low complexity and low coupling, there is no evidence this class requires further decomposition."
