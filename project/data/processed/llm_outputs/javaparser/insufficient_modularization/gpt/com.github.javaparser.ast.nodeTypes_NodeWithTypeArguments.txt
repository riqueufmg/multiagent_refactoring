    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithTypeArguments",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is not flagged for Insufficient Modularization because it is small and cohesive: LOC=35, NOM=6, WMC=6 (low overall complexity per method), LCOM=-1.0 (indicates high cohesion). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it only depends on two types (com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList, com.github.javaparser.ast.type.Type). These metrics indicate the class is compact and well-focused, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
