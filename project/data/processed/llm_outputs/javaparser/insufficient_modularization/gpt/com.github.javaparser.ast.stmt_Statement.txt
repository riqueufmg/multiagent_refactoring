    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.Statement",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High size and complexity: LOC=264, NOM=92, WMC=92 (many methods with substantial complexity). Many dependencies on specific statement-related types (26 dependencies listed), and a large number of children/variants (NC=62) while inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=3). Together these indicate the class concentrates many responsibilities/variants in one place rather than being decomposed, so it exhibits Insufficient Modularization."
