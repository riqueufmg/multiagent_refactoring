    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.constraintformulas.ExpressionCompatibleWithType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high implementation complexity (wmc = 45) and a non-trivial size (loc = 165) while defining many behaviors (nom = 11 methods, nopm = 5 public methods). Although it has a small number of fields (nof = 3), the class depends on a wide set of responsibilities (AST node handling: LambdaExpr, ConditionalExpr, EnclosedExpr, BlockStmt, Statement; type-inference and solver logic: TypeInference, TypeHelper, MethodType, InferenceVariable, BoundSet, TypeSolver, TypeInferenceCache, ControlFlowLogic, FunctionalInterfaceLogic, JavaParserFacade). This combination of high complexity, multiple methods and diverse external concerns suggests the class is handling several responsibilities that could be split into smaller, focused modules to reduce complexity and size."
