    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: loc=62 (small class size), nom=11 and nopm=10 (number of methods is moderate but methods are small on average), wmc=16 (moderate complexity, not excessively high), lcom=0.0 (high cohesion), nof=2 (few fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling). With shallow inheritance (dit=1) and no nested complexity (nc=0), there is no clear evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
