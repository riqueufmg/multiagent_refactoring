    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=12, number of methods (nom)=2, number of fields (nof)=1 and public fields (nopf)=1. Complexity is low (WMC=2). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Depth of inheritance (DIT=2) and LCOM=1.0 do not indicate excessive internal complexity or size that would be reduced by further decomposition. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization."
