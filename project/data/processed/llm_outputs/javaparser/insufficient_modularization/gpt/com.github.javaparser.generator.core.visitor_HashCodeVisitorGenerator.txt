    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=44, NOM=2, NOPM=1 and WMC=8 indicate limited size and moderate complexity. LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show few external interactions. Given the low number of methods and modest complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
