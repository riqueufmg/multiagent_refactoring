    "justification": "Large class size (loc=257) combined with few methods (nom=4, nopm=3) and many fields (nof=10) indicates concentrated implementation; very low cohesion (lcom=1.0) shows methods/fields are not well grouped; average ~64 LOC per method (257 LOC / 4 methods) suggests methods are large and could be split. The presence of distinct translator dependencies (LookupTranslator, CharSequenceTranslator) further suggests multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed. These elements justify Insufficient Modularization."
