    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of Insufficient Modularization: very large size (LOC = 536), a very high number of methods (NOM = 177, NOPM = 175) and high complexity (WMC = 180) indicate it is doing too much. Cohesion is very low (LCOM = 0.983), suggesting many methods are unrelated and the class has multiple responsibilities. It depends on a large set of collaborators (47 listed dependencies) and exposes many operations, which together imply it should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes or interfaces. Additional indicators supporting decomposition are the high number of children/collaborators (NC = 71) and moderate inheritance depth (DIT = 3) while fanin/fanout are 0 (isolated high internal complexity). These metrics collectively justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
