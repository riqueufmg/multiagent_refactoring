    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being too large/complex for a single class: high number of methods (nom = 41, nopm = 40) and substantial size (loc = 233) together with high complexity (wmc = 67). It exposes many behaviours while holding very little state (nof = 3, nopf = 0), which often indicates procedural logic that can be split into smaller collaborators. The class also depends on a large set of types (≈20 distinct dependencies listed), suggesting multiple responsibilities or concerns. Although cohesion (lcom = 0.317) is not extreme, it is not sufficient to offset the high method count and complexity. These factors together indicate Insufficient Modularization — the class is a candidate for decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
