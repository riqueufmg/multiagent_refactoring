    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=27, nof=2 (only two fields), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), dependencies=[]. There is no evidence of a large, complex implementation that requires decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
