    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: LOC=6, NOM=1, WMC=1 indicating very small size and low complexity. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 and a single dependency (com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType) indicate low coupling. With only one method and minimal implementation, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
