    "justification": "The class is minimal and does not show signs of needing decomposition: LOC=3, WMC=0, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=2 (only two fields), LCOM=-1.0 (no method cohesion to evaluate), fanin=0, fanout=0, and no dependencies. These metrics indicate very low size and complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
