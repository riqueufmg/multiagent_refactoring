    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.SymbolSolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class. The class has 14 methods (nom) and 106 LOC — moderate size, not excessively large. Cohesion is high (LCOM = 0.142857...), which suggests a single, focused responsibility rather than multiple unrelated concerns. Although complexity (WMC = 26) is non-trivial, it is not extreme for 14 methods and can reflect algorithmic work typical of a solver. Inheritance depth (DIT = 1) is shallow and fanin/fanout are 0, so there is no evidence of tangled coupling that would point to missing decomposition. The number of external dependencies is relatively high, but that is expected for a symbol solver interacting with many resolution types and does not by itself imply insufficient modularization. Therefore, given the provided metrics in isolation, do not flag Insufficient Modularization."
