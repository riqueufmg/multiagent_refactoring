    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=8, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0, Fan-in=0, Fan-out=0, no dependencies. These metrics indicate minimal size and complexity, so there is no indication it must be further decomposed. The DIT=4 shows inheritance depth but does not imply the class itself is insufficiently modularized."
