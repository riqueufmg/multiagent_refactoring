    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is very small and low complexity: LOC=9, NOM=1, WMC=1. It has no fields (NOF=0), no public fields (NOPF=0), no measured coupling (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0), and a trivial cohesion indicator (LCOM=-1.0). These metrics show no evidence of a large, complex class that would benefit from further decomposition. The single-method, low-LOC nature indicates appropriate modularization rather than insufficient modularization. (DIT=21 is noted but, in isolation, depth alone does not indicate an undecomposed, overly large class.)"
