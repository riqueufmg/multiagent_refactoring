    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is already minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=11 (very small), NOM=0 and WMC=0 (no methods/low complexity), NOF=1 and NOPF=1 (single field), NC=0 (no nested components), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling), LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion concerns reported). Given the lack of size, complexity, and coupling, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
