    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=17, NOM=5, WMC=5. It has no fields (NOF=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and LCOM=-1.0 (no evidence of low cohesion). Given the small size, low complexity, and lack of dependencies, there is no indication that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
