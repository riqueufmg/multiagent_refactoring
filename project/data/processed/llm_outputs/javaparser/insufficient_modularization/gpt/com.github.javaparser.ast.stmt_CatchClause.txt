    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.CatchClause",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit clear Insufficient Modularization. Metrics: nom=13, loc=83, wmc=20, lcom=0.4615, nof=2, fanin=0, fanout=0, dit=3. Although it has 13 methods, the overall size (83 LOC) and moderate WMC (20) are not large enough to indicate an overly monolithic class. LCOM ≈ 0.46 indicates reasonable cohesion rather than scattered responsibilities, and only 2 fields imply limited state to be split out. The lack of fanout suggests it is not a hub of many responsibilities. Taken in isolation, these indicators support that the class is of moderate complexity and reasonably modular, so do not justify declaring Insufficient Modularization."
