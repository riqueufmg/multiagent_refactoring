    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.MethodDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows characteristics of insufficient modularization: very high number of methods (nom = 39) and public methods (nopm = 37) indicating many responsibilities, high weighted methods complexity (wmc = 61), and substantial size (loc = 228). Cohesion is only moderate (lcom = 0.538), suggesting the methods are not tightly focused on a single responsibility. The class has very few fields (nof = 2) while exposing many behaviors, which is a common sign that behavior should be split into smaller classes. Additionally the inheritance depth (dit = 5) and a large set of external dependencies (many entries in the dependencies list) increase the implementation complexity. These combined metrics justify flagging Insufficient Modularization and recommending further decomposition."
