    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ComponentPatternExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: loc=11, nom=2, wmc=2 and nof=0. It has no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no listed dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and low implementation complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further or that it would benefit from additional modularization."
