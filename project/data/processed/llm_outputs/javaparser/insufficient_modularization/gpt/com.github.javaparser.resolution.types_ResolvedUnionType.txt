    "justification": "Do not detect Insufficient Modularization: the class is small (loc=46) with a single field (nof=1) and moderate method count (nom=9) and complexity (wmc=12). Cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.333) and coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0). Inheritance depth is minimal (dit=1). These metrics indicate the class is reasonably cohesive and not overly large or complex, so further decomposition is not indicated."
