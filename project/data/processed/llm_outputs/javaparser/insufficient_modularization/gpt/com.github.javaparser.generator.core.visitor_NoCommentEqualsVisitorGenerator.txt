    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.visitor.NoCommentEqualsVisitorGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=32, NOM=2 (only 2 methods, 1 public), WMC=8 (moderate complexity but contained), LCOM=-1.0 (indicates cohesion), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no broad coupling). Given the low size (LOC, NOM) and measured cohesion, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
