    "justification": "Not detected. The class is small (loc=36) with a modest number of methods (nom=8) and low implementation complexity (wmc=8). Cohesion appears good (lcom=-1.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although the inheritance depth is moderate (dit=4), the size and complexity metrics do not indicate that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
