    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=15, nom=3, wmc=4 (low complexity). LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. No fields (nc=0) and minimal dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0, only three external types used) imply the behavior is focused and stateless. Given its small size and low complexity, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
