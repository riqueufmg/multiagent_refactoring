    "class": "com.github.javaparser.JavaToken",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows indicators of being insufficiently modular: large size (loc = 404), high method count (nom = 28, of which nopm = 25 are public) and high complexity (wmc = 40). These metrics indicate the class carries many responsibilities and implementation branches that could be split. It also depends on several related types (com.github.javaparser.TokenTypes, com.github.javaparser.Range, com.github.javaparser.TokenRange, com.github.javaparser.utils.LineSeparator, com.github.javaparser.Token, com.github.javaparser.JavaToken.Category, com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParserConstants), suggesting multiple areas of functionality. Although cohesion is relatively high (lcom = 0.107), the combination of large LOC, many public methods, and high WMC supports that further decomposition would likely reduce size and complexity. Additionally, depth of inheritance is zero (dit = 0), so refactoring into smaller collaborating classes is feasible."
