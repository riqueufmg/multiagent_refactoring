    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=10, wmc=1, nom=1, nof=2. Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single listed dependency). These metrics indicate low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed or would benefit from further modularization."
