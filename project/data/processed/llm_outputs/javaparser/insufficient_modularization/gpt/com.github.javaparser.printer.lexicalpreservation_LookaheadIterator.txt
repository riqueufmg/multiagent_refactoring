    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=13, NOM=2, WMC=2 indicating low complexity and few responsibilities; LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion; DIT=0 and NC=1 show no inheritance complexity; fanin=0 and fanout=0 and no dependencies indicate low coupling. Given the minimal size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition (insufficient modularization) is needed."
