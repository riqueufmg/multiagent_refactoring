    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.VoidVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits Insufficient Modularization: nom (number of methods) = 103 and wmc = 103 indicate a very large API surface with high aggregate complexity. loc = 109 with 103 methods implies many tiny methods but an overall monolithic interface. The dependency list contains a very large and diverse set of AST node types (e.g. MethodDeclaration, IfStmt, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, CompilationUnit, ArrayType, SwitchStmt, Module* directives, many expression and statement types), showing the class is responsible for handling many unrelated concerns. nof/nopf/nopm = 0 and fanin/fanout = 0 indicate it is stateless but does not reduce the fact it aggregates many responsibilities. These metrics and the broad set of dependencies justify that the class should be decomposed (for example into visitors grouped by statements, expressions, types, declarations, modules/comments) to improve modularity and reduce size/complexity."
