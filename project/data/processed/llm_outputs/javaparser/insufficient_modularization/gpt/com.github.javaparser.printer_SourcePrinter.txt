    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.SourcePrinter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class appears insufficiently modular: it has high size and complexity for a single class (LOC = 181, WMC = 34) and a large API surface (NOM = 19 methods, NOPM = 13 public methods). Although LCOM = 0.2105 does not show total incohesion, it is low enough to indicate multiple responsibilities or clusters of behavior that could be separated. The class depends on several distinct concerns (PrettyPrinterConfiguration, PrinterConfiguration, Indentation, Position, Utils), suggesting mixing of printing logic, configuration/formatting and position/utility handling. With DIT = 0 (no inheritance to distribute behavior) and nontrivial complexity, these factors indicate the class should be decomposed into smaller, focused classes (for example separating configuration/formatting and low-level printing utilities) to reduce size and implementation complexity."
