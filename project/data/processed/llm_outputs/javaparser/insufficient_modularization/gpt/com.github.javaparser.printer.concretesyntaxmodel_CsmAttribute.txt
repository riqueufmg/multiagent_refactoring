    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=48, NOM=5, NOF=1, LCOM=0.0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). Although WMC=16 indicates some internal complexity, the overall size and high cohesion do not support that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition in isolation."
