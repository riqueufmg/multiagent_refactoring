    "justification": "Detected based on class-internal metrics and dependencies indicating multiple responsibilities and implementation complexity: 17 methods (nom=17) all public (nopm=17) creating a large public surface; high complexity (WMC=31) and moderate size (LOC=128) suggesting heavy implementation inside one class; small number of fields (NOF=3) while many methods operate on few fields implies behavior could be split into cohesive parts; cohesion is not high (LCOM=0.3529411764705882) indicating partial lack of cohesion; and the class depends on many distinct concerns (TokenRange, NodeList, Name, Type, visitor and observer-related types and meta-model classes) which suggests it handles multiple responsibilities. Together these facts support that the class is insufficiently modular and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
