    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=28 (small size), NOM=6 and WMC=6 (low overall complexity), NOF=1 (single field), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling). These values suggest the class is small, cohesive and not a candidate for further decomposition."
