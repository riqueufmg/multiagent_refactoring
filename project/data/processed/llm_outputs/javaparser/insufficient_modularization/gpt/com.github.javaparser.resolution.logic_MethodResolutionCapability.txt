    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=3, NOM=1, WMC=1. It shows high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0) and very low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a single listed dependency. There is no size or complexity evidence suggesting further decomposition; thus Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
