    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.cache.InMemoryCache",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and not overly complex: LOC=44, WMC=10 and NOM=10 indicate methods are simple and size is low. Cohesion is acceptable (LCOM=0.3). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on CacheStats). Given these metrics and analyzing the class in isolation, there is no strong evidence that it has not been decomposed or that splitting it would reduce size or complexity."
