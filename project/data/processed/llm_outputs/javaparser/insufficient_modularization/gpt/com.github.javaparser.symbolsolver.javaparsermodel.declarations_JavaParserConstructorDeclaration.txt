    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=53, NOM=11, WMC=13 (moderate complexity). High cohesion indicated by LCOM=0.0. Only 3 fields (NOF=3) and no public fields (NOPF=0). Low coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a limited set of external dependencies. Given its modest size and strong cohesion, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
