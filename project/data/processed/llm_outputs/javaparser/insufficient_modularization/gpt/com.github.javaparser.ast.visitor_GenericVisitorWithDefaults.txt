    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.GenericVisitorWithDefaults",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class contains an extremely large number of methods (nom = 105) and matching weighted method count (wmc = 105), indicating many distinct responsibilities implemented in one class; it has 326 LOC while exposing 105 operations, which suggests it is serving as a large aggregator of behavior rather than a focused component. The dependency list includes 104 distinct AST node/types (e.g., YieldStmt, ForStmt, MethodDeclaration, IfStmt, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, CompilationUnit, SwitchStmt, etc.), showing the class is coupled to a very large set of concerns. With shallow inheritance (dit = 1) and no recorded fan-in/fan-out, the functionality appears centralized in this single class instead of being modularized. These elements together justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and would benefit from decomposition (for example by splitting visit logic by node groups or responsibilities)."
