    "class": "com.github.javaparser.serialization.JavaParserJsonDeserializer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: moderate size (loc=126) combined with high implementation complexity (wmc=22) spread over a small number of methods (nom=8) indicates concentrated complex logic. It depends on many distinct concerns/types (CompilationUnit, JavaToken, NodeList, JavaParserMetaModel, Node, PropertyMetaModel, StaticJavaParser, Position, BaseNodeMetaModel), suggesting the class handles multiple responsibilities (AST nodes, tokens, positions, meta-model handling and parsing utilities). These factors (high WMC relative to NOM, multiple unrelated dependencies, and concentrated LOC) justify that the class should be further decomposed into smaller, more focused modules."
