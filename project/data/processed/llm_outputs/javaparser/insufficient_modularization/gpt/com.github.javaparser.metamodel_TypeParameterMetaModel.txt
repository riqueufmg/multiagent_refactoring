    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=10, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=2, LCOM=0.0. It has no fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single dependency (PropertyMetaModel). Although DIT=4, the low size and complexity and high cohesion indicate no need for further decomposition; insufficient modularization is not detected."
