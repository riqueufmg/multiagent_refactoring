    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.EnumConstantDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a high number of methods (nom = 21) and a high weighted method count (wmc = 38) while being a relatively large file (loc = 137). Cohesion is only moderate (lcom = 0.5238095238095238) and there are few fields (nof = 3) relative to behavior, suggesting multiple behavioral clusters not centered on shared state. The inheritance depth (dit = 4) adds complexity. The dependency set (visitors, comments, node/range types, resolution types) indicates the class handles diverse concerns (AST node structure, visitors, comments, resolution), supporting the conclusion that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
