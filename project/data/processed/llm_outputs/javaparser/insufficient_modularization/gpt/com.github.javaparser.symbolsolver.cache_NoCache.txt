    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and does not show signs of insufficient modularization: LOC = 37 (small size), NOM = 9 with WMC = 9 (average per-method complexity ≈1), NOF = 0 (no fields to split out), LCOM = -1.0 (indicating high cohesion), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (no coupling pressure to split), DIT = 1 (shallow hierarchy). Only a single dependency (com.github.javaparser.resolution.cache.CacheStats) is listed. These elements indicate the class is compact, cohesive, and low-complexity, so further decomposition is not warranted."
