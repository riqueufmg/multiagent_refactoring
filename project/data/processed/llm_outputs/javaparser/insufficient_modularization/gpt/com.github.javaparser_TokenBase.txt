    "class": "com.github.javaparser.TokenBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and not complex: LOC=13, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=2. It has no methods (NOM=0) and no measurable method complexity (WMC=0), minimal size (LOC=13), low coupling (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0), and no inheritance depth (DIT=0, NC=1). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or that it requires further decomposition."
