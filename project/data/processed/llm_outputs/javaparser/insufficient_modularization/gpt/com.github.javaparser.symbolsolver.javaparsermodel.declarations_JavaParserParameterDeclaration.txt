    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=40, NOM=6, WMC=9 and LCOM=0.0 indicate limited size, moderate complexity and high cohesion. It has only 2 fields and no public fields (NOF=2, NOPF=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling recorded (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no excessive number of methods to justify further decomposition. Although DIT=4 shows inheritance depth, there is no evidence from the provided metrics that the class is doing multiple responsibilities or is overly large/complex, so 'Insufficient Modularization' is not detected."
