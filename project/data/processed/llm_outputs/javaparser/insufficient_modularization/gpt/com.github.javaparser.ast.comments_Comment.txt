    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Multiple indicators of insufficient modularization: high number of methods (nom = 35) concentrated in a single class; relatively high complexity (WMC = 43) for one class; low cohesion (LCOM = 0.714) which suggests methods are not closely related; small instance state (nof = 2) while providing many behaviors implies procedural/coarse-grained responsibilities that could be split; presence of several specialized comment types in dependencies (TraditionalJavadocComment, LineComment, JavadocComment, MarkdownComment, BlockComment) suggests responsibilities could be delegated to more focused classes. Together these metrics indicate the class is a candidate for further decomposition."
