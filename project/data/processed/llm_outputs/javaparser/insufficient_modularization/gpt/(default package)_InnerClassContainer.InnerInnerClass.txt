    "justification": "Not detected: the class is trivial and does not show signs of insufficient modularization. Metrics: LOC = 10 (very small size), NOM = 0 (no methods), NOF = 0 (no fields), WMC = 0 (no complexity), fan-in = 0, fan-out = 0, dependencies = [] — no internal complexity or size that would motivate further decomposition. LCOM = -1.0 is not providing evidence of poor cohesion."
