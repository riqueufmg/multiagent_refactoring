    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC = 48 and NOM = 4 (only 1 public method), indicating limited responsibilities. WMC = 10 gives an average per-method complexity (~2.5) but is not high enough given the small size to justify further decomposition. LCOM = -1.0 suggests high cohesion among methods. DIT = 2 is shallow inheritance and fanin/fanout = 0 show no wide coupling. Taken in isolation, these metrics do not provide evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
