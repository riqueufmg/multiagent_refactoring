    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.MethodCallExprContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it is large (loc = 312) and highly complex (wmc = 86) while containing many methods (nom = 19) but relatively few public entry points (nopm = 5). The wide set of dependencies indicates multiple distinct responsibilities being handled in one class (e.g. MethodCallExpr, MethodResolutionLogic, LeastUpperBoundLogic, ResolvedLambdaConstraintType, ResolvedTypeVariable, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, TypeSolver, JavaParserFacade, ContextHelper, MethodUsage). These metrics and the variety of concerns (method resolution, type inference/LUB, lambda constraint handling, generics/type parameter resolution, reference/type reasoning) support that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from further modularization to reduce size and complexity."
