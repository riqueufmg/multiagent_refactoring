    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ReceiverParameterMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple (LOC=11, WMC=1, NOM=1) with only three fields (NOF=3) and no public methods requiring further split (NOPM=0). It shows high cohesion (LCOM=0.0), minimal dependencies (fanout=0, single dependency: PropertyMetaModel), and no incoming calls (fanin=0). These metrics indicate the class is already well modularized; there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
