    "justification": "Small, simple class: LOC=22, no methods (nom=0) and WMC=0, only 2 fields (nof=2). Low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). No evidence of high implementation complexity or large size that would indicate further decomposition is needed. LCOM value does not indicate a cohesion problem that would require modularization."
