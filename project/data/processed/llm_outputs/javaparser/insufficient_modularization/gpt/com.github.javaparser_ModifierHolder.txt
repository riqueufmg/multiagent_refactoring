    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=13, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=3. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, only two listed dependencies). There is no sign of large size or high implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
