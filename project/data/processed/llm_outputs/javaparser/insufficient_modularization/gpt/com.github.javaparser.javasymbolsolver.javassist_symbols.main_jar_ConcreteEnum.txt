    "class": "com.github.javaparser.javasymbolsolver.javassist_symbols.main_jar.ConcreteEnum",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=3, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), two fields (nof=2, nopf=2), low complexity (wmc=0), no inheritance depth (dit=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and contains no implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
