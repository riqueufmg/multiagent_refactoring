    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high method count (nom = 21) and non-trivial size (loc = 114) indicate many responsibilities; high cyclomatic/maintenance complexity (wmc = 32) means methods are complex and the class is likely doing too much; low cohesion (lcom = 0.6666666666666666) implies members are not highly related and could be split into separate units; depth of inheritance (dit = 4) increases conceptual complexity and may combine inherited behavior with class-specific functionality; the class depends on a variety of collaborators (NodeList, Name, visitor interfaces, TokenRange, meta-model types) suggesting multiple roles. Together these metrics justify refactoring into smaller, more cohesive classes or components."
