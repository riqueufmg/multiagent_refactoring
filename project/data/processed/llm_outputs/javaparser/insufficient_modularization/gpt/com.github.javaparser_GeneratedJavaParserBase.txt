    "class": "com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParserBase",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows multiple indicators of being insufficiently modularized: high size (LOC = 345) and high complexity (WMC = 77) together with a large number of methods (NOM = 35) indicate it implements many responsibilities and could be decomposed. It has very few fields (NOF = 2) which suggests many methods are not tightly bound to instance state and the class may be grouping disparate functionality procedurally. Although LCOM = 0.2857 does not show extreme lack of cohesion, it does not outweigh the large method count, size, and complexity. Additional supporting evidence: DIT = 0 (no inheritance-driven decomposition) and a large set of external dependencies (many AST, token, and parsing-related types in the dependency list) implying the class touches multiple concerns (token management, AST node creation/manipulation, parsing utilities). Together these metrics justify that further decomposition into smaller, focused classes would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
