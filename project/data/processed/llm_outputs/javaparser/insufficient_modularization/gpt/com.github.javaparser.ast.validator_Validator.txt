    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no evidence of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=10), only one method (nom=1) and low complexity (wmc=1), no fields (nof=0), and high cohesion (lcom=-1.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two listed dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already simple and well-focused, so further decomposition is not warranted."
