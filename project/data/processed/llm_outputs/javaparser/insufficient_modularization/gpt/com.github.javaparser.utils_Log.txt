    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: modest size (LOC=106), small number of methods (nom=7, nopm=6), low-to-moderate complexity (WMC=8), very high cohesion (LCOM=0.0), only one field (nof=1), and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a single listed dependency (Log.Adapter). These factors suggest the class is not a candidate for further decomposition in isolation."
