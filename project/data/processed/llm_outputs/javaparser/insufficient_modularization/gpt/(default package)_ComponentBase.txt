    "justification": "Metrics show no evidence of insufficient modularization: LOC=2, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOFP=0, WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0, and no dependencies. The class has no methods, no fields, zero complexity and negligible size, so there is no indication that it should be further decomposed."
