    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=13, NOM=4, WMC=4 indicate low size and complexity. LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 and a single dependency (com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.BlockStmt) show limited coupling. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
