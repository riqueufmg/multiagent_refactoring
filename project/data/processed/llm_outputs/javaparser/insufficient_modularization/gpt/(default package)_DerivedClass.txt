    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: nom=1 (one method), loc=7, wmc=1. It has no fields (nof=0), no public fields (nopf=0), no package methods (nopm=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate no necessity for further decomposition; there is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would justify Insufficient Modularization."
