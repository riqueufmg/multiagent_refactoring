    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: loc = 40 and nom = 10 (nopm = 10) indicate modest size; wmc = 10 is moderate but not excessive. There are no fields (nof = 0, nopf = 0), reducing state-related complexity, and LCOM = -1.0 does not indicate poor cohesion. Coupling appears low (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) despite the listed dependencies. Although DIT = 5 shows the class is deep in an inheritance tree, that alone does not imply the class itself is insufficiently modular. Based on these metrics in isolation, there is no strong evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
