    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserTypeParameter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has high size and complexity (loc=149, WMC=42) and a large public surface (nom=30, nopm=29) which suggests many responsibilities. It depends on a wide variety of concepts (e.g. Navigator, JavaParserFacade, TypeSolver, Node, RecordDeclaration, MethodDeclaration, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, ResolvedType/ResolvedReferenceType/ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration), indicating mixed concerns (AST navigation, type resolution, symbol lookup). Cohesion is not high (LCOM=0.5) while fields are few (nof=2), implying behavior is not tightly bound to a small, focused state. Together these metrics and diverse dependencies support that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
