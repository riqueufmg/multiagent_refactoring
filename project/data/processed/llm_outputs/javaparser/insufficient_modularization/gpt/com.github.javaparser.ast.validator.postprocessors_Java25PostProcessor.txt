    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is trivial and presents no signs of being insufficiently modularized: LOC=5, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=0 (no fields), WMC=0 (no internal complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0. These metrics indicate very small size and no implementation complexity to decompose. Although DIT=16 indicates deep inheritance, there is no evidence of a large undecomposed responsibility in this class, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
