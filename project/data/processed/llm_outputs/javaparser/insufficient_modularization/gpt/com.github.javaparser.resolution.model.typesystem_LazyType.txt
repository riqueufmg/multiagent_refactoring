    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.typesystem.LazyType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exposes signs of insufficient modularization: a high number of methods (nom = 21, nopm = 21) and high complexity (wmc = 22) relative to its size (loc = 70) and very few fields (nof = 2). Despite a shallow inheritance depth (dit = 1), it depends on many distinct type kinds (ResolvedPrimitiveType, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, ResolvedWildcard, ResolvedArrayType, ResolvedReferenceType, ResolvedTypeVariable, ResolvedType), indicating multiple responsibilities for handling different type variants. These metrics (many methods + high WMC + small number of fields + multiple type dependencies) suggest the class could be further decomposed to reduce complexity and improve modularity."
