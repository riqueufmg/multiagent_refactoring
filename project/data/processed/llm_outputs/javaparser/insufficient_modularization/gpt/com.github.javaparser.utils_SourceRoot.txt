    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceRoot",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being too large and carrying multiple responsibilities: LOC = 453 (large size), NOM = 40 with NOPM = 34 (many methods, many public methods), and WMC = 59 (high implementation complexity). Dependencies reference multiple distinct concerns (inner types and roles such as SourceRoot.ParallelParse, SourceRoot.VisitFileCallback, SourceRoot.Callback, plus parsing and utility classes like JavaParser, ParserConfiguration, ParseResult, CodeGenerationUtils, Log), indicating parsing orchestration, parallel parsing, file-visiting and callback management are all handled within this class. DIT = 0 (no inheritance decomposition) and only 8 fields (NOF = 8) suggest functionality is concentrated rather than partitioned. Together these metrics and referenced responsibilities justify that the class has insufficient modularization and would likely benefit from decomposition (e.g., separating parsing orchestration, parallel execution, file-visit traversal, and callback handling)."
