    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.ObjectIdentityHashCodeVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows characteristics of insufficient modularization: very large number of methods (nom = 104) and high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc = 104) concentrated in a single class; substantial size (loc = 318) indicating many responsibilities in one file; extensive list of dependencies on many distinct AST node types (the class depends on many com.github.javaparser.ast.* node classes), which implies it handles many different cases/concerns rather than delegating them; shallow inheritance (dit = 1) meaning the functionality is not decomposed via subclassing; and fanin/fanout = 0 while having high internal complexity, suggesting a monolithic, self-contained implementation. These factors together justify flagging this class as a candidate for further decomposition/refactoring."
