    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedVoidType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=21), few methods (NOM=5, NOPM=4), low complexity (WMC=5), single field (NOF=1), no coupling to other classes (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1). These metrics indicate the class is small, simple and cohesive and does not require further decomposition."
