    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=17, NOM=4, WMC=4, NOF=1 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low size and low complexity with high cohesion. No fan-out or fan-in (fanout=0, fanin=0) and no nested decomposition needed (NC=0). Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or should be further decomposed."
