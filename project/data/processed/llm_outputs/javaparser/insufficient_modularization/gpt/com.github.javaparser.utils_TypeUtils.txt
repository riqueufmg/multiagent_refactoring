    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization: loc=38 (small size), nom=3 (few methods), wmc=8 (moderate complexity), nof=0 (no fields), lcom=-1.0 (no evidence of low cohesion), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling that would suggest multiple responsibilities). These values suggest the class is small and cohesive and does not require further decomposition."
