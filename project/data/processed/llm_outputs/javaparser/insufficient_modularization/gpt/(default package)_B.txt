    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc=10), few fields (nof=2) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=0), no coupling/usage (fanin=0, fanout=0), shallow inheritance (dit=0) and a reported cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0). These metrics indicate the class is minimal and lacks the large size or high complexity that would justify further decomposition."
