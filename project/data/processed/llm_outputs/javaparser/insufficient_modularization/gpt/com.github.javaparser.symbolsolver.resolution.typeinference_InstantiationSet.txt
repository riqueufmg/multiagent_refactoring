    "justification": "Class metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class. Size is small (loc=43) with a modest number of methods (nom=9, nopm=8) and few fields (nof=2). Complexity is moderate (wmc=12) and cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.3333333333333333), suggesting related responsibilities. There are no incoming/outgoing coupling signals (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no deep inheritance or nested structure (dit=0, nc=0). Only three dependencies are listed. Taken in isolation, these elements do not justify further decomposition."
