    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=22, NOM=3, WMC=6 indicate low size and moderate complexity. LCOM=0.0 shows high cohesion. Field count is small (NOF=3, NOPF=0) and inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=1). Coupling is negligible (FANOUT=0, FANIN=0) and there are no dependencies. These metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large, or overly complex class, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
