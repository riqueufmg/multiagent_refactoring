    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being too large and behavior-heavy: 22 methods (nom = 22) all public (nopm = 22), 167 LOC, and a high weighted methods complexity (wmc = 45). Although it has a small number of fields (nof = 4), the moderate cohesion (lcom = 0.4545454545454545) indicates the methods are not tightly focused on a single responsibility. A relatively deep inheritance (dit = 4) increases conceptual complexity. The provided dependencies (NodeList, Statement, Expression, Node, visitor types, etc.) indicate the class handles multiple concerns (AST node structure, expression/statement components, and visitor interactions). Together these metrics justify that further decomposition (extracting responsibilities or helper components) could reduce size and implementation complexity."
