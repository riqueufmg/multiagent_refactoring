    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=23, WMC=4, NOM=4 (NOPM=3). There are no field-level exports (NOPF=0) and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although LCOM=0.75 shows some cohesion concern, the overall size and low complexity (few methods, low LOC/WMC) make further decomposition unlikely to meaningfully reduce size or implementation complexity. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
