    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.TextElement",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it declares 19 methods (nom = 19) with 13 non-private/public methods (nopm = 13) producing a large public API surface; a weighted methods complexity of 19 (wmc = 19) indicates substantial implementation burden; the file is compact (loc = 38) but contains many methods (high methods-to-LOC density), suggesting multiple responsibilities bundled together and candidates for extraction. There are 2 constructors (nc = 2) and a shallow inheritance depth (dit = 1), so decomposition is likely internal rather than via subclassing. Although LCOM = -1.0 implies cohesion is not obviously low, the high method count and large public surface justify refactoring into smaller, more focused classes or components."
