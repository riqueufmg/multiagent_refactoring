    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.CompactConstructorDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc=237), high implementation complexity (wmc=59), many methods (nom=29 with nopm=28 public methods) and only moderate cohesion (lcom=0.379). The deep inheritance level (dit=4) further increases class responsibility. The combination of many methods, high complexity, and moderate/low cohesion indicates the class likely contains multiple responsibilities that could be split into smaller, more focused classes or components. Relevant elements: loc, wmc, nom, nopm, lcom, dit (and the listed external dependencies)."
