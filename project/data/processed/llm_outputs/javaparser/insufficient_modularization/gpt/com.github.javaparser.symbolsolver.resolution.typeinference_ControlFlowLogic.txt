    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.ControlFlowLogic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected. The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (LOC=132) combined with many methods (NOM=22) and a large public surface (NOPM=17) indicating multiple responsibilities or API surface. High complexity (WMC=47) suggests internal implementation complexity that could be reduced by decomposition. The cohesion metric (LCOM=0.318) is not very high and does not rule out that parts of the class address distinct concerns. The dependency list includes many different AST statement/node types (IfStmt, BlockStmt, LabeledStmt, ContinueStmt, BreakStmt, DoStmt, AssertStmt, EmptyStmt, LocalClassDeclarationStmt, LocalRecordDeclarationStmt, VariableDeclarationExpr, ExpressionStmt, Statement, GenericVisitor, GenericVisitorAdapter, Node), implying the class handles many statement-specific control-flow cases — a strong signal it bundles multiple behaviors that could be split into smaller, focused components. These factors together justify refactoring into smaller modules/classes."
