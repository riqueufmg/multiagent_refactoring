    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.Node.PostOrderIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics show no indication of insufficient modularization: modest size (LOC=85), low complexity (WMC=0, NOM=0), small number of fields (NOF=4), and no inter-class coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these values and analyzing the class in isolation, there is no evidence it should be further decomposed."
