    "class": "a.RefCycleClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=8, NOM=1, NOF=2, WMC=1, LCOM=0.0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only depends on a.RefCycleEnum. Given the low size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
