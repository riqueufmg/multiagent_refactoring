    "justification": "No. The class is small and cohesive: LOC=28, WMC=5 (low complexity), NOM=5 and NOF=2 (few methods/fields). LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 show limited coupling. There is no indication of a large size or high implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
