    "justification": "Metrics show a very small, trivial class: loc=5, nom=0, nof=0, nopf=0, wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods or fields and no internal complexity or dependencies to indicate multiple responsibilities that should be separated. While dit=15 is high, in isolation there is no evidence within this class of insufficient modularization (no large implementation to decompose)."
