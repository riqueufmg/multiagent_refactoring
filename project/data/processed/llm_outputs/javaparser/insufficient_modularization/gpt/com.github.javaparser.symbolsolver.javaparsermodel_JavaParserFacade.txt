    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.JavaParserFacade",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 494) and high implementation complexity (wmc = 108); many methods (nom = 39) with a high count of public methods (nopm = 29), indicating many responsibilities/exposed behaviors; it depends on a wide and heterogeneous set of concepts (examples from dependencies: AST node & expression types — MethodCallExpr, ObjectCreationExpr, FieldAccessExpr, LambdaExpr, ThisExpr, NameExpr, TypeExpr, AnnotationExpr, AnnotationDeclaration; type/resolution concepts — ResolvedType, ResolvedTypeDeclaration, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, ReferenceTypeImpl, SymbolResolver, SymbolSolver, JavaSymbolSolver, TypeSolver, MethodUsage, SymbolReference; resolution logic — MethodResolutionLogic, ConstructorResolutionLogic; support/utility classes — JavaParserFactory, TypeExtractor, FailureHandler), which suggests mixed responsibilities (AST traversal/interpretation, symbol resolution, type extraction, resolution logic orchestration, factory/failure handling) within one class; lack of internal decomposition aids — no nested classes (nc = 0) and no inheritance (dit = 0) to distribute behavior. Although LCOM is relatively low (0.2308) indicating some cohesion, the combination of large size, high complexity, many public methods, and many heterogeneous dependencies supports that the class should be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
