    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=34, 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3), single field (nof=1), low complexity (WMC=7), very low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), low inheritance depth (DIT=1) and perfect cohesion metric (LCOM=0.0). Given its small size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no indication that further decomposition is warranted when considering the class in isolation."
