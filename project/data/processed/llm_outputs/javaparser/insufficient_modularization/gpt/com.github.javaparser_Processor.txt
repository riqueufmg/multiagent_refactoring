    "class": "com.github.javaparser.Processor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization not detected: the class is very small and simple (loc=13) with only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2), no fields (nof=0), and low complexity (wmc=2). Cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0), inheritance depth is zero (dit=0), and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class does not contain enough size or complexity to warrant further decomposition."
