        "Class size is small (loc = 14) and implementation complexity is low (wmc = 2), so there is no evidence it needs further decomposition to reduce size or complexity.",
        "The class has few methods (nom = 2) and a small number of fields (nof = 3), indicating limited internal responsibilities; lack of external coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) suggests no sprawling dependencies that would be simplified by splitting.",
        "Depth in the inheritance tree (dit = 3) and the single listed dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) do not by themselves indicate insufficient modularization for this class in isolation."
