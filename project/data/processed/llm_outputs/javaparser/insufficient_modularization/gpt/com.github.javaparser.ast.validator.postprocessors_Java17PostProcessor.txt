    "justification": "Class is very small and contains no decomposable content: loc=5, nom=0, nopf=0, nopm=0, wmc=0. It has no internal complexity or responsibilities to split (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). Although DIT=8 indicates deep inheritance, in isolation there is no internal size or complexity that would benefit from further modularization. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
