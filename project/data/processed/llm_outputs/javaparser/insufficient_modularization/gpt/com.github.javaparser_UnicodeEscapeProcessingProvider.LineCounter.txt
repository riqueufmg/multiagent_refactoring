    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: number of fields = 3, number of methods = 0, WMC = 0, LOC = 69, fanin = 0, fanout = 0. The class has no methods and zero measured complexity, low coupling (fanin/fanout), and only three fields, so there is no evidence from the provided data that it contains multiple responsibilities or excessive implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
