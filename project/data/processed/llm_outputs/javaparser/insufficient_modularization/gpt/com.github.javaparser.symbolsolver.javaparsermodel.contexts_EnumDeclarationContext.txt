    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=31, NOM=5 (NOPM=4), NOF=1, LCOM=0.0 indicating high cohesion. Complexity is modest (WMC=9) and depth is shallow (DIT=2). Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependency list is limited. Given the small size, low coupling, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
