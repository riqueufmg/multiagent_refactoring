    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=31, number of methods=6, WMC=7 (low complexity), number of fields=2, LCOM=0.333 (reasonable cohesion). There are no high coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no large method count or large size that would suggest insufficient modularization."
