    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.ObjectCreationContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=30 and NOM=3 indicate limited size and surface area; WMC=8 shows only moderate complexity across a few methods; LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion; fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate low coupling to other classes. There is no evidence of many responsibilities or excessive implementation complexity that would justify splitting the class."
