    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.NoCommentEqualsVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 702), very high complexity (WMC = 366), and a large number of methods (NOM = 109, of which 104 are public as indicated by nopm = 104). Cohesion is relatively low (LCOM = 0.7614678899082569), and the class depends on a very large set of AST node types (~105 distinct dependency types), indicating multiple responsibilities. These metrics together justify that the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization (splitting responsibilities into smaller, more cohesive classes or visitors)."
