    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.AbstractJavaParserContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows indicators of insufficient modularization: relatively high size (loc=187) and high complexity (wmc=49) for a single class; a non-trivial number of methods (nom=15, nopm=12) suggesting many responsibilities or a wide public surface; moderate cohesion (lcom=0.3333) which indicates the class is not highly focused; and a large set of diverse dependencies (Navigator, JavaParserFacade, JavaParserFactory, PatternVariableVisitor, various AST node/expr and resolution types) implying it coordinates multiple concerns (pattern handling, symbol resolution, factory/visitor behavior). These combined metrics strongly suggest the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
