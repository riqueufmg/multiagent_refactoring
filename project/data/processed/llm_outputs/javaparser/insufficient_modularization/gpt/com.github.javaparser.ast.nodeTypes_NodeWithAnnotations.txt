    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithAnnotations",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has 20 methods (nom=20) and 147 lines of code (loc=147), its weighted method count (wmc=20) indicates moderate complexity and the LCOM value (-1.0) indicates good internal cohesion. The inheritance depth is zero (dit=0) and there is no measured coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Its dependencies are narrowly focused on annotation-related types (NormalAnnotationExpr, AnnotationExpr, MarkerAnnotationExpr, SingleMemberAnnotationExpr, Expression, NodeList, StaticJavaParser), suggesting a single, cohesive responsibility (handling annotations). Taken in isolation, these metrics do not show the typical signs of an under-modularized class (very high complexity, low cohesion, or broad unrelated responsibilities), so insufficient modularization is not detected."
