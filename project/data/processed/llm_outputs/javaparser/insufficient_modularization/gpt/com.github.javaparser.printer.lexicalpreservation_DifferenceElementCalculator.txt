    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.DifferenceElementCalculator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 253) and high complexity (WMC = 52) indicate it is doing a lot of work; moderate cohesion (LCOM = 0.4545) suggests multiple responsibilities rather than a single well-focused role; it declares 11 methods (NOM = 11) but only 1 public method (NOPM = 1), meaning many internal/private helpers that could be split into collaborating classes; presence of an inner type (DifferenceElementCalculator.ChildPositionInfo) and many varied dependencies (NodeText, CsmElement, ChildTextElement, LexicalDifferenceCalculator, CsmToken, TokenTextElement, LexicalPreservingPrinter, Node) imply handling distinct concerns (node/token text, concrete syntax model, lexical diff logic) that are candidates for decomposition. These elements together justify that the class should be further decomposed."
