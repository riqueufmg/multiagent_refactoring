    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.Node.Level",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class size and complexity are low: LOC=45, WMC=0, NOM=0. It has only a few fields (NOF=3) and no methods, indicating a simple data/marker-type rather than a large, monolithic class. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, no dependencies). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate poor cohesion in this isolated view. Based on these metrics, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
