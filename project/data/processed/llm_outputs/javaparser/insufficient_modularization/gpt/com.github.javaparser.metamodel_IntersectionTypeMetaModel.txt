    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=9, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=1. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency). There is no evidence of a large, complex, or multi-responsibility implementation that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
