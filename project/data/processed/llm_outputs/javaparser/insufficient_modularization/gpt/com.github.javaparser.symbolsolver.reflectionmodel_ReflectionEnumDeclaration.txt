    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionEnumDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has a non-trivial size and complexity (loc=149, nom=23, wmc=40), its cohesion is very high (lcom=0.0) and it holds only a small number of fields (nof=3). High cohesion indicates the methods are closely related and the class appears focused on a single responsibility. There is no strong evidence of multiple unrelated responsibilities that would justify further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
