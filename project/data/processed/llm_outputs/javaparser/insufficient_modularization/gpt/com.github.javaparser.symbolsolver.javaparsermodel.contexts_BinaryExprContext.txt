    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=44, NOM=4 (NOPM=2), no fields (NOF=0), LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Although WMC=10 is at a modest complexity threshold, the overall size and public API are small and there is no internal state to split out. DIT=3 alone does not imply insufficient modularization. Therefore further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided metrics and dependencies."
