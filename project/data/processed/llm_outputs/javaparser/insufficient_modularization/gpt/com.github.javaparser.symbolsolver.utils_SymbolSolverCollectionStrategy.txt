    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.utils.SymbolSolverCollectionStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has non-trivial size and complexity (LOC=71, WMC=22) with 7 methods (NOM=7) all exposed as public (NOPM=7). Cohesion is only moderate (LCOM=0.4285714285714285), suggesting the methods are not highly related. With minimal inheritance (DIT=1) and being self-contained (fanin=0, fanout=0), functionality appears concentrated in this single class. The combination of high WMC, multiple public methods and moderate cohesion supports that the class is insufficiently modularized and could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
