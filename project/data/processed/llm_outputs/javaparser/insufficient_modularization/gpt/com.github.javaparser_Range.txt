    "justification": "Although the class has a moderate size (loc=170) and number of methods (nom=22) with a WMC of 28, the low LCOM (0.0909090909090909) indicates high internal cohesion. The class has only 2 fields (nof=2, nopf=2) and a single external dependency (com.github.javaparser.Position) with no fanin/fanout, suggesting methods operate on shared, related state rather than multiple unrelated responsibilities. These metrics do not support Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
