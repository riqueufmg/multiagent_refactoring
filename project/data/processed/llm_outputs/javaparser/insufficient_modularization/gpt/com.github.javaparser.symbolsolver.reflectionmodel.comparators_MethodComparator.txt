    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization. Metrics: LOC=18, NOM=1 (single method), NOPM=1, NOF=0 (no fields), LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling). WMC=6 indicates some complexity in the single method but not enough size or internal complexity to justify further decomposition in isolation."
