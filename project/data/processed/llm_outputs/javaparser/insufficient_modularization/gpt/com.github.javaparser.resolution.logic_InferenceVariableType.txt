    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic.InferenceVariableType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs that further decomposition could reduce size/complexity: it has 11 methods (nom = 11) with 9 public methods (nopm = 9), a relatively high cyclomatic/complexity weight (wmc = 25) and non-trivial size (loc = 94). The combination of many public methods and high WMC indicates a sizable public surface and internal complexity that can be split into smaller responsibilities. The class also depends on multiple distinct type-related abstractions (ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, ResolvedWildcard, ResolvedReferenceType, TypeSolver, ResolvedType), suggesting it handles several conceptual concerns that could be modularized. These metric values justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
