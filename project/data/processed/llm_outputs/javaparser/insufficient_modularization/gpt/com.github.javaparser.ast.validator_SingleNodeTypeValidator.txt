    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=17, WMC=3, NOM=2, NOF=2. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. Low complexity and few responsibilities (2 methods) suggest no further decomposition is needed. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=2). These elements do not indicate insufficient modularization."
