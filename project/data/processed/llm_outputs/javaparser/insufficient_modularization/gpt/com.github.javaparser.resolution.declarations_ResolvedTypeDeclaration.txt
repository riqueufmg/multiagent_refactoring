    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate potential insufficient modularization: nom=25 (many methods), loc=144 (large class size), wmc=26 (relatively high cyclomatic complexity). The class depends on multiple distinct declaration types (ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, ResolvedRecordDeclaration, ResolvedAnnotationDeclaration, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, ResolvedInterfaceDeclaration, ResolvedEnumDeclaration, ResolvedClassDeclaration), suggesting it covers several conceptually different responsibilities. Although LCOM = -1.0 suggests good cohesion, the combination of high method count, size and complexity together with many distinct dependency targets supports that further decomposition (splitting responsibilities or extracting smaller interfaces/classes) could reduce implementation complexity and size."
