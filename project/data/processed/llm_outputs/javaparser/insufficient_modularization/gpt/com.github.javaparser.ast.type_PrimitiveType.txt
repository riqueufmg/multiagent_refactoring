    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.PrimitiveType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Insufficient modularization detected: the class has a high method count (nom = 28) and high weighted methods complexity (wmc = 29) within a compact size (loc = 137), indicating dense, potentially multi-responsibility code. Cohesion is low (lcom = 0.714), which suggests the methods are not strongly related and the class likely mixes concerns. The depth of inheritance (dit = 4) increases inherited responsibilities, and the variety of dependencies (visitor interfaces, metamodel, resolution types, observers, token/range classes) implies the class touches multiple unrelated concerns (parsing, visiting, resolving, meta-modeling, observing). These metrics together justify further decomposition to reduce size and complexity and to improve cohesion."
