    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=31, NOM=6, WMC=6, LCOM=0.0. No inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no coupling reported (fanin=0, fanout=0). It has a low number of fields (NOF=4) and few external dependencies (2). Given its small size, low complexity and perfect cohesion, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
