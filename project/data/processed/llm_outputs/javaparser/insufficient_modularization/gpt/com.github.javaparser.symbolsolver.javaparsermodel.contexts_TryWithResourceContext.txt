    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High implementation complexity concentrated in few methods: WMC = 20 with NOM = 5 and LOC = 57 indicates several large/complex methods that could be split. All methods appear public (NOPM = 5), suggesting multiple responsibilities exposed rather than encapsulated. The class depends on many distinct concepts (TryStmt, NodeList, SymbolReference, Value, ResolvedValueDeclaration, TypeSolver, Navigator, StatementContext, Node, JavaParserSymbolDeclaration), which implies it handles varied concerns. DIT = 3 increases inheritance-related complexity. Taken together, these metrics point to insufficient modularization: the class is doing multiple things and contains complex methods that could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
