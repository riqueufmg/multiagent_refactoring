    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: 13 LOC, 4 methods (nom=4) and low complexity (WMC=4). It has no fields (nof=0) and very low coupling (fanout=0, fanin=0). LCOM=-1.0 indicates good cohesion. Given these metrics there is no evidence that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
