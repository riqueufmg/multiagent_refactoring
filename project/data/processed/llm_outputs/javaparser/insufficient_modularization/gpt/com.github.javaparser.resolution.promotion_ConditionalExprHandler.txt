    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.promotion.ConditionalExprHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is minimal and does not show signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=3), only one method (nom=1) with low complexity (wmc=1), no fields (nof=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and a single external dependency. These metrics indicate the class is already highly focused and unlikely to benefit from further decomposition."
