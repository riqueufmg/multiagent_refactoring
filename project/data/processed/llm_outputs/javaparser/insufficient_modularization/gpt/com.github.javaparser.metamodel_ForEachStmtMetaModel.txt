    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.ForEachStmtMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity, so further decomposition is not warranted: loc=11, wmc=1, nom=1, nof=3. It shows high cohesion (lcom=0.0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency: com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel). Given these metrics and considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
