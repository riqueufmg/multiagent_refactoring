    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected due to evidence of a large, complex class that likely embodies multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed: LOC = 324 (large size); WMC = 88 (high cyclomatic/implementation complexity); NOM = 15 (many methods) with NOPM = 12 (many public methods); NOF = 2 (very few fields relative to methods, suggesting behavior is not narrowly focused on a small state); LCOM = 0.5333 (moderate/low cohesion). The class also depends on many different concepts/types (examples: ResolvedType, JavaParserFacade, JavaParserFactory, TypeSolver, Node, CompilationUnit, various Resolved... declarations and AST node types), indicating it mixes concerns (type resolution, AST handling, declarations, factory/facade usage). Taken in isolation, these metrics and dependency variety justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
