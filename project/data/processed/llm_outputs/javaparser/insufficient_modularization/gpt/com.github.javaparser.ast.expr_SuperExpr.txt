    "justification": "Multiple indicators show the class likely bundles multiple responsibilities and can be further decomposed: 1) High number of methods (nom = 17) while having very few fields (nof = 1) — many behaviors operating on little shared state often indicates multiple responsibilities. 2) Elevated complexity (wmc = 25) relative to size (loc = 90) — complexity concentrated in one class suggests splitting can reduce implementation complexity. 3) Low cohesion (lcom = 0.588) — cohesion below 0.6 indicates methods are not strongly related, pointing to insufficient modularization. 4) Deep inheritance (dit = 4) increases cognitive load and, combined with the above, suggests the class is doing more than a single, well-focused role. 5) The variety of external dependencies (visitors, metamodel, observer, token/range, name, node, expression types) indicates multiple concerns (visiting, metadata, observer behavior, token/range handling), supporting decomposition into smaller, focused classes."
