    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedReferenceType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large and complex: 51 methods (nom=51), 42 public methods (nopm=42), 377 LOC (loc=377) and a high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=100). It has only 5 fields (nof=5) but covers many type-related concerns as shown by its dependencies (ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, LazyType, ResolvedTypeTransformer, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, ResolvedTypeParametersMap, ResolvedWildcard, ResolvedPrimitiveType, ResolvedTypeVariable, ResolvedType, AccessSpecifier), which implies multiple responsibilities. Although LCOM is low (0.117647...) indicating cohesion, the combination of high method count, many public API methods, large LOC and high WMC indicates the class has not been fully decomposed and could be split to reduce size and implementation complexity."
