    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class appears to be a small data holder: 3 fields (nof=3) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) with zero method complexity (wmc=0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has only two dependencies. Although LOC=83, the absence of behavior (methods) and low coupling indicate there is no evidence that the class is a large, complex unit that should be further decomposed; therefore insufficient modularization is not detected."
