    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: loc=14, nof=1 (one field), nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods and no coupling/dependencies indicating a large or complex implementation. Given its small size and zero measured complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
