    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC = 94 (moderate size), WMC = 17 (moderate complexity), NOM = 8 with 5 public methods (bounded interface), LCOM = 0.25 (good cohesion). DIT = 1 and fanin/fanout = 0 show limited inheritance/coupling. Although there are 7 fields, overall size, complexity and cohesion values do not justify further decomposition when the class is considered in isolation."
