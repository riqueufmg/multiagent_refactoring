    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=27, nof(fields)=1, nom(methods)=0, wmc=0. Low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no methods to indicate high implementation complexity. These metrics do not show a large, complex class that needs further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
