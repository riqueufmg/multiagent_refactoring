    "justification": "High lack of cohesion (LCOM = 1.0) with 3 methods (nom = 3) and only 1 field (nof = 1) indicates the methods do not share state and implement unrelated responsibilities. Although the class is small (loc = 12, wmc = 3), the combination of maximal LCOM and multiple independent methods suggests the class has not been fully decomposed and could be split to improve modularity. fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 imply it is self-contained, so internal decomposition is feasible."
