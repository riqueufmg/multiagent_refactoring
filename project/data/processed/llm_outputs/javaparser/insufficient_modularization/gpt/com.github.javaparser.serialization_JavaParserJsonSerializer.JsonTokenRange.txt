    "justification": "Class is very small and simple in isolation: LOC=8, number of fields=1 (nof=1), number of methods=0 (nom=0), WMC=0, DIT=0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0. There is no measurable internal complexity or many responsibilities to split (LCOM=-1.0 not indicating cohesion issues here). Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized."
