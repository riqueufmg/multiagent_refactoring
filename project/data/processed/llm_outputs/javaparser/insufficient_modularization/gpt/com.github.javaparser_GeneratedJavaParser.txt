    "class": "com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits clear signs of Insufficient Modularization: extremely large size (loc = 10520), an enormous number of methods (nom = 789) with many public methods (nopm = 166), and very high complexity (wmc = 5113). It also has a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 30) and depends on a very large set of AST node types and parser-related classes (e.g., many com.github.javaparser.ast.* types, GeneratedJavaParserTokenManager, ParseException). Although LCOM is low (0.0076), that does not offset the class-level size and complexity: a single class implementing hundreds of methods and thousands of complexity points strongly indicates it has multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
