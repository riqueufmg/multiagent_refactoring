    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: a relatively high number of methods (nom=13) combined with moderate size (loc=71) and elevated complexity (wmc=17) while having low cohesion (lcom=0.6923076923076923). The deep inheritance level (dit=4) increases responsibility surface, and the variety of dependencies (Name, NameExpr, ResolvedAnnotationDeclaration, JavaParserMetaModel, AnnotationExprMetaModel, TokenRange, Range, Node, ObservableProperty) suggests multiple concerns. Together these metrics indicate the class likely mixes responsibilities and could be further decomposed to reduce complexity and improve cohesion."
