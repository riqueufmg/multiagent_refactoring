    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.PatternExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "PatternExpr shows signs of insufficient modularization: it defines many operations (nom=13, nopm=13 — all methods are public) while having only 1 field (nof=1), suggesting multiple responsibilities are implemented in a single class. Complexity is relatively high (WMC=17) for a modest size (LOC=66), and cohesion is low (LCOM=0.692), indicating methods are not strongly related and the class could be split to improve cohesion and reduce complexity. A deep inheritance level (DIT=5) and multiple external dependencies (visitor types, TokenRange, Node, Type, metamodel, ObservableProperty) further imply mixed concerns. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, which combined with the above suggests the class concentrates functionality rather than delegating it — supporting decomposition as a refactoring opportunity."
