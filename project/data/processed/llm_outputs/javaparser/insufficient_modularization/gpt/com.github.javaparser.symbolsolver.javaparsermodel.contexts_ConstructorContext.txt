    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has very small size and complexity: nom=2 methods, loc=14, wmc=3. It has no fields (nof=0) and no outgoing coupling (fanout=0). Cohesion indicator is high (lcom=-1.0). Dependencies are limited (3). Given the low method count, low complexity, absence of fields, and low coupling, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
