    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.NormalCompletionVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size and complexity (LOC = 198, WMC = 43) with many methods (NOM = 18, NOPM = 16) indicate substantial implementation bulk; low cohesion (LCOM = 0.833) together with only one field (NOF = 1) implies methods do not share state and likely implement separate responsibilities; the dependency list includes many distinct AST statement node types (LabeledStmt, WhileStmt, ForStmt, IfStmt, SwitchStmt, TryStmt, ReturnStmt, BreakStmt, ContinueStmt, ThrowStmt, YieldStmt, DoStmt, BlockStmt, SwitchEntry, SynchronizedStmt, etc.), suggesting the class handles many different visit behaviors. These elements collectively justify that the class should be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive modules."
