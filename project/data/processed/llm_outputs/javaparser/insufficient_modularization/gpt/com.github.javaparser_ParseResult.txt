    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=87 (small class), NOM=10 with NOPM=10 (moderate number of methods), WMC=14 (moderate complexity), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion), NOF=4 and NOPF=0 (no public fields, good encapsulation), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (low coupling). Dependencies list is small (3). Overall size, cohesion and complexity are within reasonable bounds, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
