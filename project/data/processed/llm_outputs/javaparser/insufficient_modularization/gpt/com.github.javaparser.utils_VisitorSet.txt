    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large class. The class has 18 methods (nom=18) and 98 LOC which are moderate, cyclomatic/implementation complexity is moderate (wmc=24), and cohesion is high (LCOM=0.111), suggesting related responsibilities. It has only 5 fields (nof=5) with no public fields reported (nopf=0) and no external coupling shown (fanin=0, fanout=0, single listed dependency). Given moderate size/complexity and good cohesion in isolation, there is no strong evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
