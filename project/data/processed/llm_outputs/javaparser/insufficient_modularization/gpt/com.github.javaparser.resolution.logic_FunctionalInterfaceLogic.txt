    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: 7 methods (nom = 7) with a relatively high weighted method count (wmc = 15) and 64 LOC indicate concentrated implementation complexity; low cohesion (lcom = 0.5714285714285714) suggests its methods are not strongly related and may represent multiple responsibilities; it has 2 fields (nof = 2) yet several methods (nom) operating on them, increasing the likelihood that behavior can be split. These metrics together justify that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
