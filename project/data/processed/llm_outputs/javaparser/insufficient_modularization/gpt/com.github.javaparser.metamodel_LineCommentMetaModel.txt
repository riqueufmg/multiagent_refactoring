    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.LineCommentMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=8, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0 (no fields). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed. The DIT=3 does not by itself justify further decomposition."
