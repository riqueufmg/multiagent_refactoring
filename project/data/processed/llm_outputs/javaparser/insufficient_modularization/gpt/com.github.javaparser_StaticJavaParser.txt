    "class": "com.github.javaparser.StaticJavaParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Multiple signals indicate insufficient modularization: the class has a large API surface (nom=40 methods, nopm=36 public methods) and substantial size (loc=397), combined with non-trivial cyclomatic complexity (wmc=41), which together imply a single class carrying many responsibilities. The dependency list covers a wide range of unrelated AST and parsing concerns (examples: CompilationUnit, MethodDeclaration, TypeDeclaration, PackageDeclaration, ImportDeclaration, Javadoc, ParserConfiguration, JavaParserAdapter), suggesting the class handles many different parsing targets and concerns. The high number of public methods and breadth of dependencies point to an opportunity to decompose this class into smaller, more focused components to reduce size and implementation complexity."
