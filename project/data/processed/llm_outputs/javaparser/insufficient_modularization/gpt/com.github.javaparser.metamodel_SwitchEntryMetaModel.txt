    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=14, nom=1, wmc=1. Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a single listed dependency (PropertyMetaModel). Number of fields (nof=6) does not coincide with high complexity or size given overall metrics. These elements indicate the class is already small and cohesive, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
