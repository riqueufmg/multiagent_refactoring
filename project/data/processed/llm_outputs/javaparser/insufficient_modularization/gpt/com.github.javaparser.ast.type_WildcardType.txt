    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected as Insufficient Modularization: the class has a large size and high implementation complexity (loc=167, nom=25, nopm=25) and a high weighted method count (wmc=42), indicating many responsibilities. Cohesion is moderate (lcom=0.48) while the field count is low (nof=2), suggesting many behaviors are not tightly bound to internal state and could be split into smaller classes or helpers. Depth of inheritance (dit=4) and the variety of dependencies (visitor types, resolution types, Node/Token types, NodeList, Range, ObservableProperty, meta-model classes) further indicate the class handles multiple concerns (parsing/visiting/resolution/metadata) that could be modularized. These metrics together justify recommending decomposition. "
