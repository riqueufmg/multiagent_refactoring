    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=8, nom=1, wmc=1. Low coupling and minimal external interaction: fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]. Cohesion is not problematic (lcom=-1.0). Given the very small size and low complexity, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
