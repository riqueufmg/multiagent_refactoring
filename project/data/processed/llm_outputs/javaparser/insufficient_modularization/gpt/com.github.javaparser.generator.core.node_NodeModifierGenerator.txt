    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.node.NodeModifierGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: it is very small (LOC 8), has low complexity (WMC 2), only 2 methods (NOM 2) and 0 fields (NOF 0), and a single public method (NOPM 1). Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin 0, fanout 0) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT 2). These metrics indicate low size and low implementation complexity, so there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
