    "justification": "Class has very small size and zero internal structure: loc=2, nom=0, nof=0, wmc=0. There are no dependencies or coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and lcom=-1.0 (not applicable). Given the absence of fields, methods, complexity or dependencies, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
