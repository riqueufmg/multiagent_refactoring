    "justification": "Class demo.Main.Callback does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is very small (LOC=6), has no fields (NOF=0), no methods (NOM=0, NOPM=0), zero complexity (WMC=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and shallow inheritance (DIT=0). These metrics indicate the class is trivial and there is no evidence it should be further decomposed."
