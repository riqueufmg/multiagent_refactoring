    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=48, WMC=3, NOM=2 (NOPM=1), and only 1 field (NOF=1). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would justify further decomposition."
