    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=9, 1 field (nof=1), 1 method (nom=1), low complexity (WMC=1). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on PropertyMetaModel). Although DIT=3, there is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would benefit from further decomposition, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
