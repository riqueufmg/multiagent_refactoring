    "class": "org.tensorflow.op.Ops",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a strong candidate for Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc = 3172) combined with a huge number of methods (nom = 313) and nearly all methods being public (nopm = 312) indicate many responsibilities that could be split. High complexity (wmc = 313) aligns with the large method count. The class also has many fields (nof = 17, nopf = 16), reinforcing its breadth of state and API surface. Although LCOM is low (0.0096), meaning cohesion is not a problem, the sheer size and public surface area suggest the class has not been decomposed and would benefit from further modularization. fanin and fanout are 0, but considering the metrics in isolation, the class is monolithic and should be split to reduce size and complexity."
