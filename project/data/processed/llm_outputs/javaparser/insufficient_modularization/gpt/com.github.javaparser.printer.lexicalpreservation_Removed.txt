    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.Removed",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high behavioral surface and complexity for a single unit: 15 methods (14 public), LOC=75 and WMC=23, which indicate substantial implementation complexity and multiple exposed responsibilities. It contains only 1 field (nof=1) but implements many operations, suggesting it is behavior-heavy rather than data-centric. The listed dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, CsmToken, CsmElement, LexicalDifferenceCalculator) show it touches AST, token and difference-calculation concerns, implying multiple responsibilities. Fan-in and fan-out are 0 (self-contained complexity) and despite a low LCOM (0.266) the combination of high method count, many public methods and elevated complexity supports that the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
