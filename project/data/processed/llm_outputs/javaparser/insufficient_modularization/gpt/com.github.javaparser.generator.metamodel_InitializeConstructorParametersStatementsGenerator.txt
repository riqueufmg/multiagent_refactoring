    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed class: small size (loc=36), few methods (nom=3), no fields (nof=0), and moderate overall complexity (wmc=11). LCOM=-1.0 suggests good cohesion. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, indicating limited coupling. Given these values, there is no evidence this class suffers from Insufficient Modularization."
