    "justification": "Class is minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition: very small size (loc=3), no methods (nom=0, wmc=0), only one field (nof=1), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no dependencies. These metrics indicate low implementation complexity and no modularization debt."
