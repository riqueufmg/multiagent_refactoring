    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an un-decomposed, overly large or overly complex class. LOC is small (48), number of fields is low (2) with no public fields (nopf=0), methods are moderate in count (nom=10) and overall complexity is moderate (WMC=11). Cohesion is acceptable (LCOM=0.4) and coupling indicators are low (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although DIT=4 shows inheritance depth, there is no evidence from the provided isolated metrics that the class should be further decomposed."
