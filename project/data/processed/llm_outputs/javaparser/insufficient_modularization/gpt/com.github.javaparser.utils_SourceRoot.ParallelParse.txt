    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=45, nof=3 fields, nom=0 methods, wmc=0, nc=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only dependency listed is com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceRoot. There is no evidence of high size, high complexity, or high responsibility that would suggest it has not been decomposed further. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
