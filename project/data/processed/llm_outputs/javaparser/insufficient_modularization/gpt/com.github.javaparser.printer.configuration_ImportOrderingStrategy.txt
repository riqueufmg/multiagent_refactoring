    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: loc=10, nom=3, wmc=3, nc=3. Low coupling and dependency surface: fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency (com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList). Given the small size, low complexity and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or needs further decomposition."
