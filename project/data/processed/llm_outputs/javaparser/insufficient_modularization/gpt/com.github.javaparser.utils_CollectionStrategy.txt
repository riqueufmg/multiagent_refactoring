    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=41), few methods (nom=4), moderate overall complexity (wmc=8) and high cohesion (lcom=-1.0). There are no fields reported (nof=0, nopf=0) and coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these values the class is compact, cohesive and not overly complex in isolation, so further decomposition is not indicated."
