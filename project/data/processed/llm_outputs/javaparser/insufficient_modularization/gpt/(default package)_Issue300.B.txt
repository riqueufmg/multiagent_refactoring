    "justification": "Class has 0 methods (nom=0), 0 fields (nof=0), very small size (loc=5), zero complexity (wmc=0), and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). With no implementation to decompose and minimal size/complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization in this class in isolation."
