    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a large or complex class that needs decomposition: loc=5, nof=0, nom=0, wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. The class has no fields or methods and very low size/complexity, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization. Although nc=6 and dit=2 show it has subclasses and inheritance depth, that suggests a small base/marker role rather than an undecomposed, complex implementation. LCOM=-1.0 and zero members provide no support for a decomposition need."
