    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.ArrayCreationExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High number of methods (nom=24, nopm=24) and moderate source size (loc=163) combined with relatively high complexity (wmc=42) indicate substantial responsibility within a single class. The class has few fields (nof=3) but many public methods, suggesting behavior is not adequately encapsulated by internal state. Cohesion is only moderate (lcom=0.4166666666666667), implying the methods are not tightly focused on a single cohesive responsibility. The dependency set (ArrayType, ArrayInitializerExpr, NodeList, TokenRange, StaticJavaParser, VoidVisitor, GenericVisitor, ObservableProperty, etc.) shows the class touches multiple concerns (type representation, initializers, parsing/token range handling, visitor/observer support). Taken in isolation, these metrics and dependencies support that the class has not been fully decomposed and could benefit from further modularization."
