    "justification": "Class is very small and simple (LOC=9, WMC=1) with a single field (NOF=1) and a single method (NOM=1). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is minimal (FANOUT=0, FANIN=0). Although DIT=3, there is no evidence of excessive size or complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
