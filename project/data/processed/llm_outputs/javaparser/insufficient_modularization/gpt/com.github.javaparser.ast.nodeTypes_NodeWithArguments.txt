    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: small size (loc=35), moderate cyclomatic complexity (wmc=11) distributed over nom=8 methods, and no instance fields (nof=0) so there is little internal state to split. High cohesion is suggested by lcom=-1.0. Low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only three external type dependencies further reduce the need for decomposition. Given these values, there is no strong evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
