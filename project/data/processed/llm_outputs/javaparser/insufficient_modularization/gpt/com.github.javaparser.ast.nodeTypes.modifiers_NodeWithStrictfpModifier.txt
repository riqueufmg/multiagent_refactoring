    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=11, number of methods (nom)=2, weighted method count (wmc)=2. Cohesion appears high (lcom=-1.0). Coupling and external interactions are negligible (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). Inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1). Given its low size, low complexity, and low coupling when analyzed in isolation, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
