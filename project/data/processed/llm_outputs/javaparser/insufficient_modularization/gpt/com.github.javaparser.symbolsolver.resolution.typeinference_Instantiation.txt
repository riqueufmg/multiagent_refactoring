    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.Instantiation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=32, NOM=6, WMC=9 indicate limited implementation complexity and size. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is no inheritance depth (DIT=0). With only 2 fields and 2 external dependencies, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed; its size and metrics do not justify further modularization."
