    "justification": "Class is small and unlikely to require further decomposition: number of methods (nom) = 2, lines of code (loc) = 16, weighted methods complexity (wmc) = 4, number of fields (nof) = 0. Cohesion metric (lcom) = -1.0 indicates high cohesion. Low external interactions: fanin = 0, fanout = 0, and only three dependencies listed. Given its low size, low complexity, high cohesion and minimal state, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
