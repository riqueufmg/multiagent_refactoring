    "class": "com.github.javaparser.TokenMgrException",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc=96) combined with high complexity (wmc=16) and low/moderate cohesion (lcom=0.6667). It contains multiple fields and methods (nof=6, nom=6, nopf=4, nopm=4) while having no external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating self-contained but potentially multiple responsibilities. These metrics suggest the class could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
