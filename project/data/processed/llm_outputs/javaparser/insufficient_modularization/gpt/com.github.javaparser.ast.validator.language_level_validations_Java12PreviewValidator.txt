    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=13, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0, NOPM=1. It has no fields and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate a single, low-complexity responsibility that does not require further decomposition. Although DIT=16 is high, the class itself remains minimal in size and complexity. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization for this class in isolation."
