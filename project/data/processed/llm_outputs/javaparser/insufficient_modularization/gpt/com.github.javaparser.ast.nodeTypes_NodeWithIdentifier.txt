    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=11, WMC=4, NOM=4. It has no fields (NOF=0) and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating little internal responsibility to split and low coupling to decompose. DIT=0 and the minimal dependency list (Utils) also argue against further decomposition. These metrics do not support the presence of Insufficient Modularization."
