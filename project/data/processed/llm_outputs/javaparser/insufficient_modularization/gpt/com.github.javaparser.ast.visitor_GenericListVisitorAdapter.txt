    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.GenericListVisitorAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is too large and complex to be a single cohesive unit: 1803 LOC and 103 methods (nom=103, nopm=103) indicate a very large implementation; very high complexity (wmc=561) shows many decision points and implementation branches; the class depends on a very large number of distinct AST node types (see provided dependencies), suggesting it handles many distinct responsibilities; shallow inheritance (dit=1) means behavior is not decomposed via subclasses. Taken together these metrics indicate Insufficient Modularization — the class should be decomposed into smaller, focused classes or visitors to reduce size and complexity."
