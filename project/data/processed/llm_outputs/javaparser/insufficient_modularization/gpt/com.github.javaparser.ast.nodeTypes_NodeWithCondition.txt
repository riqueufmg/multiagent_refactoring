    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=4, NOM=2, WMC=2 show low size and complexity. LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and depth of inheritance is 0 (DIT=0). Given these values, there is no evidence the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
