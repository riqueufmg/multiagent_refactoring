    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=31, NOM=5 and WMC=6 indicate low size and moderate complexity; NOF=0 (no fields) and LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion). FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 show no coupling to other classes in the provided data. Given the low method count, small size and high cohesion, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization requiring decomposition."
