    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and contains few responsibilities. Metrics show LOC=53 and nom=4 (only four methods), indicating limited size and surface area to decompose. Cyclomatic/complexity (wmc=14) is moderate but given the low method count does not indicate a large, monolithic class. Coupling indicators are low (fanin=0, fanout=0), and depth of inheritance is shallow (dit=2). These elements together do not support the presence of Insufficient Modularization."
