    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.AssignExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (LOC=130) with a high number of methods (NOM=19, public methods ~18) and high complexity (WMC=27). Cohesion is moderate/low (LCOM=0.5789), indicating the class likely mixes responsibilities. The combination of many public members and elevated complexity suggests the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
