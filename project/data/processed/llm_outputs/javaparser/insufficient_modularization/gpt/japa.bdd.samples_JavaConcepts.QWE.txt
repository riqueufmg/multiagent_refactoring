    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0) and zero measured complexity (wmc = 0), so there is no internal implementation to further decompose. Although LOC = 44, that size is not supported by method count or complexity to indicate insufficient modularization. Additional supporting metrics: nof = 2 (two fields), fanin = 0, fanout = 0, dit = 2, lcom = -1.0 (no meaningful cohesion data). Given the absence of methods and complexity, the Insufficient Modularization smell is not detected."
