    "justification": "The class is very small and contains no behavioral complexity: LOC=11, NOF=1, NOM=0, WMC=0. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no methods to further decompose. Given its minimal size and complexity, there is no evidence it has not been sufficiently modularized."
