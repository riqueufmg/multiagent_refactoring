    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=22, NOM=3, NOPM=3 and WMC=5 indicate low size and low complexity. LCOM=-1.0 suggests good cohesion. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 indicate low coupling. DIT=2 does not imply excessive responsibility. Dependencies are minimal (2). These metrics do not support Insufficient Modularization."
