    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=11, NOM=2 (only 2 methods), WMC=2 (low complexity). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating no sprawling responsibilities or heavy dependencies. DIT=2 is modest and LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate poor cohesion here. Given the low size, low complexity, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization requiring further decomposition."
