    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is already minimal: nof=2 (only two fields), nom=0 (no methods), loc=6 (very small), wmc=0 (no complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling). LCOM=-1.0 reflects non-applicability due to absence of methods. Given its small size and lack of behavior, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
