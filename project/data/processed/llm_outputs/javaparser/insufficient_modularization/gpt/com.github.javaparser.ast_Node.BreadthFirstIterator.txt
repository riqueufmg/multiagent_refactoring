    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=18, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=1. Coupling and dependencies are minimal/absent (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). There is no evidence of high size, high complexity, or excessive responsibilities that would motivate further decomposition. (LCOM=-1.0 does not provide evidence of poor cohesion here.) Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected for this class in isolation."
