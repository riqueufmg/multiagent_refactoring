    "justification": "No. Metrics show a very small, trivial class with LOC=13, no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (WMC=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no dependencies; LCOM=-1 (not applicable). These values provide no evidence that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition."
