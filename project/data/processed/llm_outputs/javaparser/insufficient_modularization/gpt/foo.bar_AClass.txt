    "justification": "Class is very small and not complex: LOC=4, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=2. Coupling and usage are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0), inheritance depth is zero (DIT=0), and LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion concern indicated). Given the minimal size and complexity, there is no evidence this class requires further decomposition."
