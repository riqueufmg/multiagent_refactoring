    "class": "(default package).Trie.Node",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being undecomposed: very small size (loc=2), no fields or methods (nof=0, nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and there is no evidence it requires further modularization."
