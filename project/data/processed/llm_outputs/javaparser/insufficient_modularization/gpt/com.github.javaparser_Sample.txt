    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=9, NOM=2, WMC=2, NOF=1. There are no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0). These metrics indicate low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity. (LCOM=1.0 is noted but, in isolation, the overall small scale of the class does not justify marking it as Insufficient Modularization.)"
