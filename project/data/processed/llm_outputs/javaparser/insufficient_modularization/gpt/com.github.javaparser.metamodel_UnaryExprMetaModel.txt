    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.UnaryExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=12, WMC=1, NOM=1 (only one method) and NOF=4 fields. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single listed dependency com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel). Although DIT=3, the low complexity and size metrics indicate the class is already well decomposed and does not require further modularization."
