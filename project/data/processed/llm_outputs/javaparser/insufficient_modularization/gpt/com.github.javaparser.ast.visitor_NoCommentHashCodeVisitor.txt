    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.NoCommentHashCodeVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of Insufficient Modularization: very large number of methods (nom = 104, nopm = 104) and high implementation complexity (wmc = 105) while being moderately large (loc = 319). It depends on a very large set of distinct AST node types (the provided dependency list contains many node classes such as IfStmt, ForStmt, MethodDeclaration, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, ArrayType, LambdaExpr, etc.), indicating it handles many responsibilities. LCOM = 1.0 suggests poor cohesion across its many methods, and DIT = 1 with fanin = 0/fanout = 0 indicates the class is a monolithic visitor rather than decomposed or reused. These elements together justify that the class should be decomposed into smaller, focused modules/visitors to reduce size and complexity."
