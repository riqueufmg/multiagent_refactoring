    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.Node",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of Insufficient Modularization: very large size and complexity (loc = 877, wmc = 150), a large number of methods and public API surface (nom = 78, nopm = 65), and many fields (nof = 26). It also has a high number of associated elements (nc = 49) and depends on many distinct concerns (examples from dependencies: Position, Printer/ConfigurablePrinter/PrinterConfiguration, Visitor types, Observer types, Comment, TokenRange, Range, NodeList, DataKey, CompilationUnit, SymbolResolver). These metrics and the diverse dependency set indicate the class is handling multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed into smaller, focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity. Note: LCOM = 0.141 shows reasonable cohesion, but cohesion alone does not offset the high LOC/WMC and broad responsibility surface that justify further modularization."
