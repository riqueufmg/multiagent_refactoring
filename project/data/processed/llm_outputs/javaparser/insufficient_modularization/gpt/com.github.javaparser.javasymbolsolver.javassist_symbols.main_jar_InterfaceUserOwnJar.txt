    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is tiny and contains no behavior to decompose: LOC=3, NOM=0, WMC=0. It has a single field (NOF=1, NOPF=1) and no method-level complexity or responsibilities to split. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and depth (DIT=1) is shallow. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
