    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=27, NOM=2, NOPM=1, WMC=5 and LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion). It has no fields (NOF=0), no fanin/fanout, and a modest DIT=2. These metrics indicate low size and complexity and do not justify further decomposition; there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
