    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity (LOC=16, WMC=4, NOM=4, NOPM=2), has no fields (NOF=0) and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Given its small size, low implementation complexity and lack of internal state or external coupling, there is no evidence that it needs further decomposition."
