    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.UnaryExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc = 105) combined with many methods (nom = 18, nopm = 18) and high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc = 23). Cohesion is moderate to low (lcom = 0.5556), suggesting multiple responsibilities or loosely related functionality that could be split. The depth in the inheritance tree (dit = 4) and multiple external dependencies (listed in input) increase conceptual complexity. These metrics together indicate the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
