    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.CloneVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is overly large and handles many responsibilities: 107 methods (nom=107) with 103 public methods (nopm=103), 1082 lines of code (loc=1082) and high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=115). It depends on a very large number of distinct AST node types (~113 different dependency types listed), indicating it contains cloning logic for many node kinds. These factors (high method count, large LOC, high WMC, and broad dependency surface) are symptomatic of insufficient modularization and justify decomposing the class into smaller, more focused components."
