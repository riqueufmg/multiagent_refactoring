    "justification": "The class is small and simple (loc=10, nom=1, wmc=1) with only 2 fields (nof=2) and zero public methods to decompose (nopm=0). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given this low size and complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
