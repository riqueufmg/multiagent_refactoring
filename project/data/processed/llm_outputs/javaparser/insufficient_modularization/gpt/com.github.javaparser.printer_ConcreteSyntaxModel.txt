    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: moderate size (loc=158) with a relatively large number of methods (nom=11) but only a few public APIs (nopm=3), implying many internal behaviors. Cyclomatic/implementation complexity is non-trivial (wmc=12) while cohesion is low (lcom=0.818), indicating methods are not tightly related. There are only 2 fields (nof=2) yet many methods operate on them, which often signals mixed responsibilities rather than clear decomposition. The variety of dependencies (CsmElement, CsmConditional, SourcePrinter, Node, ObservableProperty, GeneratedJavaParserConstants) further suggests the class handles multiple concerns. Taken together, these metrics justify refactoring into smaller, more cohesive components."
