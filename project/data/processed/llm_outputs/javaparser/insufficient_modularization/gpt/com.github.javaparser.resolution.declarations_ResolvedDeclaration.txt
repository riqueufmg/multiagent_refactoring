    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed class: number of methods (nom) = 15 is moderate, lines of code (loc) = 94 is small-to-moderate, and weighted method count (wmc) = 15 implies average per-method complexity ≈1. There are no fields (nof = 0) and no public fields (nopf = 0). Cohesion is high (lcom = -1.0), inheritance depth is shallow (dit = 1, nc = 3), and coupling appears low (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Although the class lists several related declaration-type dependencies, those do not, in the provided isolated data, indicate multiple unrelated responsibilities or excessive size/complexity that would justify further decomposition. Therefore, Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
