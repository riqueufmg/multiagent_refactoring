    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.chunks.CommonValidators",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class concentrates implementation complexity in a single method (nom = 1) while exhibiting relatively high complexity and size for that method (wmc = 9, loc = 41). It has no fields (nof = 0), so state is not preventing decomposition, and the complexity is therefore concentrated in one routine. These indicators suggest the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and could benefit from splitting the large/complex method into smaller methods or helper classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
