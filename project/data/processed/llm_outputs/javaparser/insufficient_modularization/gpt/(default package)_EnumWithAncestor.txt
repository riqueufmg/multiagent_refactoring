    "justification": "The class is trivial and contains no decomposable implementation: LOC=1, NOM=0, NOPM=0, WMC=0, NC=0. It has no fields or methods, and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). Given the lack of internal behavior or complexity, there is nothing to further modularize, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
