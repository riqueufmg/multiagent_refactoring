    "justification": "The class is minimal and contains no internal complexity or responsibilities that suggest further decomposition: LOC=2, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion problem. With zero methods/fields and no dependencies, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
