    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: nom (number of methods) = 0, nopf/nof = 0 (no fields), wmc (complexity) = 0, loc = 44 (moderate size), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (no coupling). There are no methods or fields to decompose, and complexity metrics are minimal, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization for this class in isolation."
