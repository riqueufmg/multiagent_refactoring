    "justification": "The class is small (loc=24) with modest complexity (wmc=9) and high cohesion (lcom=-1.0). It has 9 methods (nom=9) but no fields (nof=0) and no external coupling reported (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the low size and evidence of cohesion, there is no strong indication that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
