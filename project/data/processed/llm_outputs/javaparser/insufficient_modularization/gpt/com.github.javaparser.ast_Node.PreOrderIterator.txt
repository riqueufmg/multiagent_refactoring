    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (loc=21), has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), very low implementation complexity (wmc=0), only one field (nof=1, nopf=0), and no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) with an empty dependency list. These metrics indicate there is no substantial implementation to further decompose in isolation."
