    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: loc=28, wmc=5, nom=5, nof=2. Cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.4) and there are no coupling indications (fanin=0, fanout=0). Depth/ nesting are minimal (dit=0, nc=0). These metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed, overly large, or complex class that would warrant further modularization."
