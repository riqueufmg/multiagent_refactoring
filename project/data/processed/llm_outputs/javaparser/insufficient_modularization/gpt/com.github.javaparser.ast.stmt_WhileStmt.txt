    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.WhileStmt",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it defines a relatively large number of methods (nom = 16) while being small in physical size (loc = 89), which suggests many distinct behaviors packed into one class. Implementation complexity is high (wmc = 23) indicating the methods collectively are complex. Cohesion is moderate/low (lcom = 0.625), implying the methods are not tightly related and could be grouped into more cohesive units. There are only 2 fields (nof = 2) but many methods operating on them, a typical indicator of a class carrying multiple responsibilities. The class has a deep inheritance level (dit = 4), which can further increase responsibility and complexity within the class. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, indicating the class is isolated and can be refactored internally without increasing coupling. Taken together (high nom and wmc, moderate/low cohesion, few fields), these metrics support detection of insufficient modularization and suggest the class could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
