    "class": "a.b.c.DataObject",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has very small size and no internal complexity: LOC=2, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0 (not applicable). No incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the absence of fields, methods, complexity, or dependencies, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition — insufficient modularization is not detected."
