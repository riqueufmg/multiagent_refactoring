    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=8, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0. It has minimal coupling (FANOUT=0, single listed dependency) and no internal state to decompose. Given its single method and very low complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
