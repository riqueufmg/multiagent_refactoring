    "justification": [
        "Large size and complexity: 211 LOC and WMC = 54 indicate substantial implementation complexity concentrated in this single class.",
        "Many methods: 31 methods (nopm = 31) — a high number of publicly accessible methods suggests multiple responsibilities or API surface that could be split.",
        "Low number of fields vs. many behaviors: only 3 fields (nof = 3) but 31 methods implies the class is performing many operations beyond managing its own small state.",
        "Cohesion is not strong: LCOM = 0.387 (non‑near‑zero) suggests only moderate cohesion, consistent with multiple responsibilities that could be separated.",
        "Depth of inheritance (DIT = 5) and broad dependency set (visitors, resolution types, AST nodes, tokens, ranges, observers, meta‑models) indicate the class participates in diverse concerns (parsing/AST, resolution, visiting/observing), which favors decomposition.",
        "Combined metrics (high method count, high complexity, moderate cohesion, many external dependencies) support that the class has not been fully decomposed and could be refactored into smaller, more focused classes."
