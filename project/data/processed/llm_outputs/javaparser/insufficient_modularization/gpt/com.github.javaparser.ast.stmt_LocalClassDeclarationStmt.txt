    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Evidence of insufficient modularization: high method count (nom=14, nopm=14) with very few fields (nof=1) — a high method-to-field ratio — combined with elevated complexity (wmc=18) in a small file (loc=70). Cohesion is low (LCOM=0.714), indicating multiple, loosely related responsibilities inside the same class. These metrics together suggest the class has not been fully decomposed and would likely benefit from splitting to reduce size and implementation complexity (DIT=4 does not mitigate the low cohesion)."
