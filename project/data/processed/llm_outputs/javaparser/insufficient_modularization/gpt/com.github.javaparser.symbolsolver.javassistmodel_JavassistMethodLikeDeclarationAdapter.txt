    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC = 65 and number of methods = 7 indicate limited size; WMC = 14 (moderate complexity across methods) does not suggest an overly complex monolithic class. LCOM = 0.0 shows high cohesion (methods operate on related data), and number of fields = 4 is modest. Fanout = 0 (no broad external coupling in the provided metrics) further argues against multiple unrelated responsibilities. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
