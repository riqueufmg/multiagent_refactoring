    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=32, WMC=0, NOF=2, NOM=0, NOPM=0 indicate very low size and complexity. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show no coupling pressure to split. DIT=4 is inheritance depth only and does not imply excessive internal complexity. Given these metrics and the limited dependencies (TypeSolver, AccessSpecifier, RecordDeclaration), there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
