    "justification": "Class has very small size and complexity: LOC=9, NOM=3, WMC=3. There are no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no reported fields or package-level members (NOF=0, NOPF=0). LCOM value (-1.0) does not indicate a cohesion problem in this tiny class. Given its minimal lines, few methods, and low complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
