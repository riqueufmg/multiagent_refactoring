    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization: size is small (loc=50), method count is moderate (nom=9), and cohesion is high (lcom=0.0). Complexity is acceptable (wmc=13) and there are no inbound/outbound coupling signals (fanin=0, fanout=0) that would suggest multiple responsibilities hidden in one class. Although DIT=4 shows inheritance depth, in isolation this does not imply the class should be further decomposed. Therefore no evidence of insufficient modularization."
