    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserAnnotationDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modular: a relatively large number of methods (nom = 19, nopm = 19 — all methods are public) combined with moderate size (loc = 77) and high cyclomatic/weight complexity (wmc = 20) indicate concentrated behavior and a large public API that could represent multiple responsibilities. Cohesion is only moderate (lcom = 0.368), suggesting methods are not tightly focused on a single concern. The deep inheritance (dit = 5) implies accumulated behavior from hierarchy that could be refactored into smaller components. The class depends on varied concepts (TypeSolver, ResolvedType, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, JavaParserTypeAdapter, AnnotationDeclaration, AstResolutionUtils), indicating mixed responsibilities (type resolution, AST adaptation, declaration handling) that are candidates for separation. Together these metrics and dependencies justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
