    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has 21 methods (nom=21), its size is small (loc=85) and methods are likely short. Cohesion is high (lcom=0.095), number of fields is low (nof=2) and complexity is moderate (wmc=24). There is no evidence of high coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth (dit=4) suggests reuse rather than a need to split. These metrics do not indicate an insufficient modularization smell."
