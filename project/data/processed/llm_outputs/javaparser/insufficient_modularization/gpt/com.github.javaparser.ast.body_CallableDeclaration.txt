    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a large size (loc = 293) and many operations (nom = 30, of which nopm = 25 are non-private/public), and high implementation complexity (wmc = 71). Cohesion is only moderate (lcom = 0.333), indicating the methods are not tightly focused on a single narrowly scoped responsibility. The class depends on many distinct concerns (Signature, Parameter, ReceiverParameter, Type, NodeList, ObservableProperty, TokenRange, JavaParserMetaModel), suggesting multiple responsibilities that could be separated. The combination of high method count, many public methods, high cyclomatic complexity, moderate cohesion, and varied dependencies justifies identifying Insufficient Modularization and recommending further decomposition."
