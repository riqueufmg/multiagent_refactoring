    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=21, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0, number of fields (nof)=1, DIT=1, fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies only reference its enclosing VisitorSet. There is no evidence of large size, many responsibilities, or high complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
