    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is very small and contains no implementation to decompose: LOC=5, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPM=0. Complexity is minimal (WMC=0) and coupling is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0), so there is nothing substantial to modularize. Although DIT=6 is high, depth alone does not imply the class itself should be further decomposed. LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion metrics are not indicating a lack of cohesion here."
