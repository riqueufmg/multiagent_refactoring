    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is very small and simple (loc=9, nom=1, nof=1), with low complexity (wmc=1) and high cohesion (lcom=0.0). It has minimal dependencies and interaction (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on PropertyMetaModel). Although DIT=3, there is no indication of excessive size or implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
