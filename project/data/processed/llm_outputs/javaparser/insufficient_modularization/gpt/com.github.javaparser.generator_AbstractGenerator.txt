    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.AbstractGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high number of methods (nom = 20) and relatively high cyclomatic/weighted complexity (wmc = 28) indicating multiple responsibilities and implementation complexity; moderate size (loc = 165) combined with low cohesion (lcom = 0.55) suggests the methods are not tightly related and could be grouped into smaller units; no inheritance depth (dit = 0) and only nc = 2 children imply the class itself bears much functionality rather than being decomposed; dependencies on many distinct AST types (CompilationUnit, EnumDeclaration, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, MethodDeclaration, SwitchStmt, Expression, Statement, CallableDeclaration, StaticJavaParser, ParseResult, SourceRoot, NodeList, TypeDeclaration) further indicate multiple concerns handled by this single class. These elements together justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition."
