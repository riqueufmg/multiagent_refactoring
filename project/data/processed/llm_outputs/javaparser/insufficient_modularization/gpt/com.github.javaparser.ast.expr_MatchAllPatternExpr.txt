    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.MatchAllPatternExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it implements a relatively large API (nom=15, nopm=15) and contains significant implementation complexity (wmc=23) within a small-to-moderate size (loc=83). Cohesion is low (lcom=0.666...), indicating the methods are not tightly related and the class likely has multiple responsibilities that could be split. There are few fields (nof=2) but many methods, suggesting behavior is not well grouped around state. The class also references several distinct dependencies (NodeList, visitors, metamodel, TokenRange, Node, observer), implying mixed concerns. Taken in isolation, these metrics justify refactoring/decomposition into smaller, more cohesive classes or components."
