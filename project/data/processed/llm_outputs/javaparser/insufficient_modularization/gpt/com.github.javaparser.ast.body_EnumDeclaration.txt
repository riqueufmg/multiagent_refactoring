    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high number of methods (nom = 23) packed into a relatively small file (loc = 134) with a high cyclomatic/weight measure (wmc = 37), indicating concentrated implementation complexity. Cohesion is moderate-to-low (lcom = 0.5217391304347826), and there are very few fields (nof = 2), suggesting many behaviors are not tightly coupled to internal state and could be split out. The deep inheritance (dit = 5) and many external dependencies (multiple AST and meta-model types listed) indicate the class handles diverse responsibilities. These elements together justify further decomposition."
