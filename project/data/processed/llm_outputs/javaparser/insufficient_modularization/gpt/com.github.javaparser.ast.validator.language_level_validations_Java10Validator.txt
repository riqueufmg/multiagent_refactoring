    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=13, nom=1, nopm=1, nof=1, wmc=1 indicate a single, low‑complexity unit. Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0). There are no external usage or dependency edges (fanin=0, fanout=0), so there is no evidence of multiple responsibilities or internal complexity that would benefit from further decomposition. Although dit=13 is high, the class itself shows no size or complexity symptoms of insufficient modularization."
