    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=38, NOM=4, NOF=2. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0, only 3 external dependencies listed). Although WMC=11 indicates some method complexity, the overall size and high cohesion do not justify further decomposition. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
