    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: WMC = 23 (relatively high per-class complexity), NOM = 16 methods (many methods for a single class), LOC = 89 (non-trivial size), and LCOM = 0.625 (moderate lack of cohesion). The class has only 2 fields while exposing 16 methods, suggesting groups of methods may operate on different subsets of state (low cohesion) and could be split into smaller, focused classes or collaborators. The combination of high complexity (WMC) and reduced cohesion (LCOM) justifies recommending further decomposition."
