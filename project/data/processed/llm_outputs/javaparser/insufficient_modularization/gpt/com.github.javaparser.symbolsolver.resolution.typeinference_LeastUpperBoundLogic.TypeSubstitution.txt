    "justification": "Class is small and non-complex: LOC=26, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), few fields (nof=3), low complexity metrics (wmc=0), no coupling recorded (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate minimal size and responsibilities, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization that would require further decomposition."
