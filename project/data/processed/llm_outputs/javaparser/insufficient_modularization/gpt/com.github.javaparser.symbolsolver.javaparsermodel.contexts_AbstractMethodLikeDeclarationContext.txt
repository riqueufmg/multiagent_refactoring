    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.AbstractMethodLikeDeclarationContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 6 methods (nom=6) but a relatively high weighted methods complexity (wmc=18), implying methods with above-average complexity (avg complexity ~3) and likely multiple responsibilities per method. The file is moderately sized (loc=58) while having no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), which indicates behavior-heavy code without encapsulated state and suggests procedural grouping rather than a well-modularized object. The class depends on multiple distinct concerns (TypeSolver, AbstractJavaParserContext, SymbolDeclarator, JavaParserFacade, SymbolReference, JavaParserFactory), showing it coordinates varied responsibilities and could be decomposed to separate those concerns. The inheritance depth (dit=2) and number of children (nc=4) further indicate it occupies a central role that may combine functionality better split into smaller, focused classes. These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
