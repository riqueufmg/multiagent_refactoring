    "class": "com.github.javaparser.UnicodeEscapeProcessingProvider",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a strong candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it has very large size (loc = 458) and high complexity (wmc = 45), with many members (nof = 24 fields) and methods (nom = 19) but only 7 public methods (nopm = 7) — indicating a lot of internal implementation. It also declares multiple nested types (PositionMappingBuilder, PositionUpdate, LineCounter, PositionMapping) which suggests multiple responsibilities are bundled inside a single class rather than decomposed into separate classes. While LCOM is low (0.105), the combination of large LOC, high WMC, many fields/methods, and multiple inner classes indicates the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from splitting responsibilities into smaller, focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
