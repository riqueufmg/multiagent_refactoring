    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java18Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: loc=9, nom=1, nopm=1, nof=0, nopf=0 and wmc=1, indicating minimal internal complexity and responsibility. Fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no coupling that would suggest a large, undecomposed role. Although dit=21 is high, the class itself contains almost no implementation to decompose, so it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
