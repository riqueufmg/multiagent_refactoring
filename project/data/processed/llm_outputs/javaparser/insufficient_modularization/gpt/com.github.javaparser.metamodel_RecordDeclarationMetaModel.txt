    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=12, WMC=1, NOM=1, LCOM=0.0. It has few fields (NOF=4) and only one dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) with fanin=0 and fanout=0, indicating low coupling. Given the very low complexity and size, there is no evidence that it has not been sufficiently decomposed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
