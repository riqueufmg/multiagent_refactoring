    "justification": "Class is very small and low complexity: LOC=8, WMC=1, NOM=1. It has no fields (NOF=0), no public fields (NOPF=0) and no public methods (NOPM=0), zero coupling in and out (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0) and no dependencies. Although DIT=3, the class size and lack of responsibilities indicate it is already sufficiently small and does not require further decomposition."
