    "justification": "The class is small and simple: 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), 11 lines of code (loc=11), and low complexity (wmc=1). Cohesion appears high (lcom=-1.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, nof=0, nopf=0). Given its size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition in isolation."
