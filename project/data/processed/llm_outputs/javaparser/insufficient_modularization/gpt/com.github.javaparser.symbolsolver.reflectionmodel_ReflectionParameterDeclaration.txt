    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a clear need for further decomposition: loc=60 (small size), nom=11 with wmc=13 (moderate complexity), nof=5 (reasonable number of fields), LCOM=0.3636 (acceptable cohesion). fanin=0 and fanout=0 indicate low coupling. While DIT=4 shows deeper inheritance, it does not by itself imply the class is insufficiently modular. Overall the class size, cohesion and complexity do not justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
