    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=15, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=2 and LCOM=0.0. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, showing no coupling pressure in the provided data. These characteristics do not show the typical signs of Insufficient Modularization (large size, high complexity, many responsibilities). The high DIT (20) alone does not imply this class should be further decomposed given its minimal size and low complexity."
