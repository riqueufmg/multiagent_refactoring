    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java22Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=61, NOM=2, WMC=3 and only 1 public method (NOPM=1). Cohesion is high (LCOM=1.0) and there is no coupling pressure (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although DIT=25 indicates a deep inheritance chain, the class itself has low complexity and few responsibilities, so there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
