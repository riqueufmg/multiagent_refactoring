    "justification": "Class is small and focused: LOC=13, NOM=1, NOPM=1, WMC=2. It has no fields (NOF=0) and shows high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). No incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
