    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: although the class has a moderate number of methods (nom=11) and a moderate complexity (wmc=17), its size is small (loc=84), it has low number of fields (nof=5) and very high cohesion (lcom=0.0). Additionally fanin=0 and fanout=0 show it is not heavily entangled. Given high cohesion and modest size/complexity, there is no strong evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
