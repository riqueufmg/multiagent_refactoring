    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.LeastUpperBoundLogic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected because the class is large and complex: 27 methods (nom = 27), 257 lines of code (loc = 257) and high cyclomatic weight (wmc = 56) — indicators of multiple responsibilities and implementation complexity that can be decomposed. Most methods are internal (only nopm = 2 public methods vs 27 total), suggesting substantial private/internal logic that could be moved to helper classes. The class depends on multiple, distinct type-resolution concerns (ResolvedType, ResolvedReferenceType, ResolvedWildcard, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, TypeHelper, and its own TypeSubstitution), indicating varied responsibilities rather than a single focused role. Although LCOM = 0.222 does not show extreme lack of cohesion, the combination of high method count, high WMC, large LOC, and many internal routines supports the conclusion of insufficient modularization and a need to split responsibilities into smaller classes."
