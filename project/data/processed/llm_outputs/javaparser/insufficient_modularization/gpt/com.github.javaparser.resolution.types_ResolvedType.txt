    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom = 29) and a sizable accumulated complexity (wmc = 30) within a relatively compact source (loc = 128), which indicates many responsibilities concentrated in one class. It depends on many distinct type kinds (ResolvedPrimitiveType, ResolvedReferenceType, ResolvedArrayType, ResolvedUnionType, ResolvedWildcard, ResolvedTypeVariable, ResolvedLambdaConstraintType, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration), suggesting it handles multiple variant behaviors rather than a single cohesive role. Given these metrics and the multiplicity of type-specific dependencies, further decomposition into smaller, focused classes or strategy/visitor components would likely reduce per-class complexity and improve modularization."
