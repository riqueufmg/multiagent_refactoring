    "justification": "No: The class is small and reasonably cohesive so further decomposition is not indicated. Evidence: LOC=58 (small size), NOM=14 with NOPM=10 (method count not excessive for size), WMC=17 (moderate complexity), LCOM=0.2857 (good cohesion), NOF=2 (few fields), DIT=1 and NC=0 (no deep hierarchy or nested complexity), fanin=0 fanout=0 (limited coupling). Dependencies are limited. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
