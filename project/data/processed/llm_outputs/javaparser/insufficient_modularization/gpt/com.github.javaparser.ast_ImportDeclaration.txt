    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: although the class has a moderate size and complexity (loc=152, nom=23, wmc=32), cohesion is high (lcom=0.2608695652173913) which suggests methods are related and the class is focused. The number of fields is small (nof=4) and coupling appears low (fanin=0, fanout=0). The inheritance depth (dit=3) and the listed dependencies are typical AST-related types rather than evidence of multiple unrelated responsibilities. Therefore further decomposition is not clearly warranted based on the provided metrics."
