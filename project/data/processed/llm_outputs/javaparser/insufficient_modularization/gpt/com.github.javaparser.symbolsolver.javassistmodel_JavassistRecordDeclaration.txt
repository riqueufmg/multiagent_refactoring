    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a strong candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it defines 39 methods (36 public) and totals 197 LOC with a high WMC of 57, indicating substantial size and implementation complexity concentrated in one class. It has only 3 fields while exposing many behaviors, which suggests behavior has been accumulated rather than decomposed into smaller collaborating objects. Although LCOM is low (0.1538) (indicating cohesion), the very large public surface and high complexity (WMC) plus a non-trivial inheritance depth (DIT=5) and multiple external dependencies increase maintenance risk and indicate that further decomposition (extracting responsibilities or helper components) could reduce size and complexity."
