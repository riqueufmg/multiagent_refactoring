    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive, not showing signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=25, NOM=1, WMC=1 indicate low size and complexity; LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion; NOF=2 fields only; FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 indicate low coupling. The single method and low complexity suggest no further decomposition is needed. (DIT=11 is high but does not by itself indicate lack of modularization.)"
