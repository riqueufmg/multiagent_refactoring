    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large or complex class: LOC is moderate (62) but there are no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and only 2 fields (nof=2), so there is nothing to further decompose into smaller behavioral units. Cyclomatic/implementation complexity is nil (wmc=0), coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0), and cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0). Although DIT=4 shows inheritance depth, that alone does not justify insufficient modularization in isolation. Therefore there is no evidence of the Insufficient Modularization smell for this class."
