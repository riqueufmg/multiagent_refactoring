    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: high method count (nom = 31), large size (loc = 230) and elevated complexity (wmc = 37) indicate multiple responsibilities or dense implementation. The cohesion metric (lcom = -1.0) flags cohesion concerns, and zero external coupling (fanout = 0, fanin = 0) suggests functionality is implemented internally rather than delegated. Together these metrics justify that the class should be decomposed into smaller, more focused units to reduce size and implementation complexity."
