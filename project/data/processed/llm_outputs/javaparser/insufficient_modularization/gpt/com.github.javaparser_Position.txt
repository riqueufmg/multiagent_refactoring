    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a clear need for further decomposition: loc=142 and nom=17 show only moderate size/number of methods; wmc=26 is borderline but not extremely high; lcom=0.0 indicates very high cohesion (methods operate on the same state); nof=7 fields is reasonable for a data/utility-like class; dit=0 and nc=1 show no inheritance complexity; fanin=0 and fanout=0 and the single dependency (com.github.javaparser.ast.Node) indicate low coupling. Given the high cohesion and moderate size/complexity in isolation, there is insufficient evidence that the class has not been decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
