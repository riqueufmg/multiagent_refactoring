    "class": "implements_duplicate.A.DuplicateTypeName",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is extremely small and contains no members or behavior that could be further decomposed: loc=2, nom=0 (no methods), nof=0 (no fields), wmc=0 (no complexity). It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no declared dependencies. Given these metrics, there is no evidence of a large, complex class that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
