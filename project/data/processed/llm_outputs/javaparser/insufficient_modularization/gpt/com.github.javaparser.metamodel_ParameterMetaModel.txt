    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small (LOC=14), has very low complexity (WMC=1, NOM=1), and high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has a single dependency. Although it has 6 fields, the low complexity and high cohesion indicate no need for further decomposition."
