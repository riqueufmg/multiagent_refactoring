    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=12, NOM=1, WMC=3 and LCOM=-1.0 (indicates high cohesion). It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a single dependency. There is no evidence of large size, high complexity, or low cohesion that would justify further decomposition."
