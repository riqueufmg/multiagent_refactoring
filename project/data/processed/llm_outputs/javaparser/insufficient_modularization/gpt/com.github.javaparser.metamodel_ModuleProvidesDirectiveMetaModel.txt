    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=10, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=2. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and it has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although DIT=3, the low size and complexity metrics indicate the class is already fine-grained and does not require further decomposition."
