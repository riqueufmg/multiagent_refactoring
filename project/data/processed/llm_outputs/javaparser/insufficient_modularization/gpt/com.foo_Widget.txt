    "justification": "LCOM = 1.0 indicates very low cohesion (methods do not share state). The class has 3 fields and 3 methods (nof=3, nom=3) but small overall size (loc=20, wmc=3), suggesting those methods implement separate responsibilities rather than a single cohesive one. Dependencies span both AST and symbol-solver concerns (CompilationUnit, ParseException, JavaParserFacade, CombinedTypeSolver, MethodDeclaration), which supports the view that the class mixes distinct responsibilities that could be split into smaller, more focused classes."
