    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Contains many methods (nom=16, nopm=15) and a high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=23) for a relatively small source size (loc=74) — indication of concentrated behavior; only one field (nof=1) while exposing many public operations suggests behavior-heavy design that could be split into smaller, stateful units; zero fan-in/fan-out indicates the class is self-contained but large, raising the chance it mixes multiple responsibilities; dependencies on CsmToken, CsmElement, TokenTypes and LexicalDifferenceCalculator indicate it touches multiple conceptual concerns (token handling, concrete syntax elements, lexical-difference logic). Together these metrics justify further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
