    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=8), only one method (NOM=1), low complexity (WMC=1), no fields (NOF=0), high cohesion indicator (LCOM=-1.0), and no coupling to or from others (fanin=0, fanout=0). While DIT=4 shows inheritance depth, by itself it does not indicate the class is insufficiently decomposed given the minimal code and complexity."
