    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it defines many methods (nom = 25, nopm = 24) and has high implementation complexity (wmc = 30) despite a relatively small overall size (loc = 112), which indicates many responsibilities packed into one class. Cohesion is only moderate (lcom = 0.28) rather than very high, so the large method count is not fully explained by a single highly cohesive responsibility. The class also has non-trivial inheritance depth (dit = 6) suggesting mixing of inherited behavior and additional responsibilities. The dependency list (e.g., ObjectCreationExpr, ObjectCreationContext, JavaParserFacade, JavaParserFactory, TypeSolver, various Resolved* types and Context) shows the class touches AST construction, resolution, contexts, type/decl handling and factory concerns — multiple conceptual areas that could be separated. Together (high nom/nopm, high wmc, moderate LCOM, varied dependencies) these elements justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
