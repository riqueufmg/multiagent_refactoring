    "class": "javaparser.GenericClass",

    "justification": "LCOM=1.0 (maximum lack of cohesion) and nom=8 with nof=1 (8 methods sharing a single field) indicate multiple unrelated behaviors in one class. loc=31 with wmc=8 shows non-trivial complexity concentrated in a small class. fanin=0 and fanout=0 show the class is isolated, so its responsibilities are likely separable. These factors justify Insufficient Modularization and suggest the class should be decomposed."
