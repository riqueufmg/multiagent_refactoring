    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=11, WMC=1, NOM=1, LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). It has only 3 fields and no fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single dependency. These metrics indicate low complexity and no need for further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
