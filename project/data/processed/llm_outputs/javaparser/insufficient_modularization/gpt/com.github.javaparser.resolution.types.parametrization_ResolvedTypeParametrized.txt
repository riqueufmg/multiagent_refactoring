    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=7, WMC=1, NOM=1, no fields (NOF=0, NOPF=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one dependency. These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization (no need to further decompose the class)."
