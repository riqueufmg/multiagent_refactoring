    "class": "extends_duplicate.A",

    "justification": "Metrics show the class is trivial and does not need further decomposition: LOC=4, no fields or methods (nof=0, nom=0, nopf=0, nopm=0), low complexity (wmc=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems in this context. Although DIT is very high (dit=3096), the class' extremely small size and lack of functionality provide no evidence of insufficient modularization."
