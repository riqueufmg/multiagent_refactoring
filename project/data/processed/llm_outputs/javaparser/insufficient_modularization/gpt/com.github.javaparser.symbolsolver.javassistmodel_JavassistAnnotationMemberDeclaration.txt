    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=45, number of methods=4, number of fields=3. Complexity is moderate/low (WMC=7) and cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). There is no evidence of excessive size, method count, or complexity that would indicate it should be further decomposed. Fan-in/fan-out are 0, so it is not highly entangled with other components. Depth of inheritance (DIT=4) does not by itself imply insufficient modularization. Therefore no decomposition smell detected."
