    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive; no evidence of insufficient modularization. Metrics: NOM=2 (only two methods), LOC=8 (very small size), WMC=2 (low complexity), LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion), Fan-in=0, Fan-out=0, NOF=0. Given the low size and complexity and high cohesion, further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
