    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.ArrayInitializerExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it declares a relatively large number of methods (nom=15) and a high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=23) while being compact (loc=83). Cohesion is low (lcom=0.6666666666666666) and there is only one field (nof=1), which suggests many methods are not tightly focused on shared state. A deep inheritance level (dit=4) indicates accumulated behavior from supertypes. The class also depends on varied concepts (NodeList, visitor types, metamodel, ObservableProperty), implying multiple responsibilities. Together these metrics indicate the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
