    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: small size (LOC=38), moderate cyclomatic/complexity (WMC=11), few methods (nom=7, nopm=7) and fields (nof=1), very high cohesion (LCOM=0.0), no inbound/outbound coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), shallow inheritance (DIT=1) and no children (nc=0). Dependencies are minimal (2 types). These elements show the class is small, cohesive, and not overly complex, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
