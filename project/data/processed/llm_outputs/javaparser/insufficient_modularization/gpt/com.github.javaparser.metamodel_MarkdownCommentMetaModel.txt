    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.MarkdownCommentMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: loc=8, nom=1, wmc=1, no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
