    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: very small size (loc = 31), few methods (nom = 2, nopm = 1), low complexity (wmc = 4), no fields (nof = 0) and high measured cohesion (lcom = -1.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). The dependency list is short and there is no sign of a large, multifaceted class that should be further decomposed. These elements suggest the class is already small and cohesive, so further decomposition is not warranted."
