    "justification": "The class is small and reasonably cohesive, so further decomposition is not indicated. Evidence: LOC=58, NOM=6, NOF=4 (few fields and methods), WMC=15 (moderate total complexity across methods), LCOM=0.5 (acceptable cohesion), DIT=1, FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no heavy coupling). These metrics show limited size and moderate complexity/cohesion, which argues against 'Insufficient Modularization'."
