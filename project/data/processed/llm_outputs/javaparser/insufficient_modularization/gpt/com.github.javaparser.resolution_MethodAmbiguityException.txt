    "justification": "Metrics show the class is already minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=12, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0 (no fields), NOPM=1, fanin=0, fanout=0. The class contains a single, low-complexity method and no fields or dependencies, indicating high trivial cohesion (LCOM=-1.0) and no excess size or complexity to modularize further."
