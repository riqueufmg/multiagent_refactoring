    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show symptoms of being an incompletely decomposed, monolithic unit: it has no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and zero behavioral complexity (wmc=0), indicating little implementation to split. It contains 5 fields (nof=5) but that alone is not large, and its LOC (63) is moderate without corresponding method complexity. Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is 0 (dit=0). Given the lack of methods and low complexity/coupling, there is no evidence in the provided metrics that further decomposition is required."
