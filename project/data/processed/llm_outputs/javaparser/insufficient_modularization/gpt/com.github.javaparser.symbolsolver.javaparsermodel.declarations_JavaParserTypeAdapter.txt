    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High implementation complexity and size indicate insufficient modularization: WMC = 41 (high cyclomatic complexity), NOM = 12 methods, LOC = 135. The class depends on many external types (10 distinct dependencies), suggesting multiple responsibilities. There are no nested types or decomposition inside the class (nc = 0) and no inheritance depth to distribute behavior (DIT = 0). Although LCOM = 0.0 implies cohesion is not low, the combination of high WMC, moderate method count and size, and many dependencies supports that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
