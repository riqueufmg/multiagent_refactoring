    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and has no behavioral complexity: loc=6, wmc=0, nom=0, nopm=0. It contains a modest number of fields (nof=4) but no methods to decompose, and has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) aside from a single dependency on com.github.javaparser.Token. These elements show no evidence of a large, complex, or multi-responsibility class that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
