    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.Type",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of Insufficient Modularization: very high number of methods (nom = 59) with almost all being public (nopm = 58) indicating many responsibilities, high weighted methods complexity (wmc = 67), and low cohesion (lcom = 0.898) which means methods are weakly related. LOC = 206 combined with the method count indicates dense behavior concentrated in one class. The class also references many distinct types (e.g., UnionType, ReferenceType, WildcardType, AnnotationExpr, IntersectionType, ClassOrInterfaceType, ArrayType, PrimitiveType, VoidType, TypeParameter, VarType, UnknownType, ResolvedType, etc.), suggesting multiple roles. These elements together justify that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
