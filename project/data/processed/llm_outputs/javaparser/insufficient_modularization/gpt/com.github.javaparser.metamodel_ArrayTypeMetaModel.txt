        "Very small size: LOC = 10 and number of methods (nom) = 1, indicating little implementation to decompose.",
        "Low complexity: WMC = 1 and nof (fields) = 2, so the class is simple and not functionally dense.",
        "High cohesion: LCOM = 0.0 implies methods/fields are cohesive, not a sign of mixed responsibilities.",
        "Low coupling: fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 with a single listed dependency (PropertyMetaModel) — no wide external coupling that suggests multiple responsibilities.",
        "Depth of inheritance (DIT) = 4 is not by itself evidence of insufficient modularization given the class's minimal size and complexity."
