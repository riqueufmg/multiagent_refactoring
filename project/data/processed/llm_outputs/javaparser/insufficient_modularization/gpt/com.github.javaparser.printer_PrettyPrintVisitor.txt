    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.PrettyPrintVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is excessively large and complex: loc=1588, nom=122 methods, wmc=346 (high complexity). It depends on a very large number of distinct AST/node types (117 dependencies listed), indicating it handles printing/visiting for many node kinds and therefore multiple responsibilities. It has very few fields (nof=3) while hosting many methods, which suggests procedural concentration rather than decomposition into smaller cooperating modules. Although lcom=0.016 indicates methods are related, the sheer size (LOC, method count) and high WMC justify decomposition to reduce class size, implementation complexity, and improve modularization."
