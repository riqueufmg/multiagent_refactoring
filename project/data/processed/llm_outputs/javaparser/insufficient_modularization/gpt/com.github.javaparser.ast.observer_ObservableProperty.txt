{
    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.ObservableProperty",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected due to the class' size and complexity: 20 methods (nom = 20) of which 16 are public (nopm = 16), 135 lines of code (loc = 135) and a weighted method count of 29 (wmc = 29) indicate substantial implementation concentrated in a single class. The class also depends on multiple types (com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.utils.Utils, com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.ObservableProperty.Type, com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList), suggesting it handles several concerns. Although cohesion is reported as low (lcom = 0.1) which implies reasonable cohesion, the high method count, high public API surface and overall complexity justify that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity, indicating Insufficient Modularization. Fan-in/fan-out are 0 (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), showing the class is self-contained but still large, reinforcing the need to consider splitting its responsibilities."
