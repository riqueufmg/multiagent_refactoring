    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=9, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=1. It shows high cohesion (LCOM=0.0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). There are no indicators of large size or high implementation complexity that would suggest it needs further decomposition. Therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
