    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No evidence of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=8), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), only a few fields (nof=3, nopf=3), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems given the absence of methods. These metrics indicate the class is too small/simple to warrant further decomposition."
