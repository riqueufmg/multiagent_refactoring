    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=10, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=2 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low complexity and high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on PropertyMetaModel). Although DIT=3, there is no evidence of multiple responsibilities or large size that would warrant further decomposition."
