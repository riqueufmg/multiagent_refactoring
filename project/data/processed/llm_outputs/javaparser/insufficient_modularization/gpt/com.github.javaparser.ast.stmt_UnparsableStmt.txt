    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC is only 42 and WMC is moderate (11). Although NOM is 11, there are no fields (NOF=0) and fanin/fanout are 0, indicating low coupling. LCOM is -1.0 (indicating cohesion rather than fragmentation). The DIT=4 reflects inheritance depth but does not by itself imply insufficient modularization. Given the small size, low coupling and apparent cohesion, there is no strong evidence of insufficient modularization."
