    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=38, NOM=4, WMC=6, NOF=3 and LCOM=0.0. There are no nested types (NC=0), no inheritance depth (DIT=0), and no coupling spikes (fanin=0, fanout=0) with only two external dependencies. Given the low size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modular or requires further decomposition."
