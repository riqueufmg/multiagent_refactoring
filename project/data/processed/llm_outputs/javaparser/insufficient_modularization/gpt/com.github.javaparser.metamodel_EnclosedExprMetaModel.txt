    "justification": "Class is small and highly cohesive: LOC=9, NOM=1, NOPF=1, WMC=1, LCOM=0.0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on PropertyMetaModel). Although DIT=3, there is no evidence of large size, high complexity, or low cohesion that would indicate a need for further decomposition. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
