    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.ReshuffledDiffElementExtractor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 161) and high complexity (wmc = 38) while exposing few methods (nom = 6, nopm = 1), which indicates long/complex methods that could be decomposed. It depends on many external concepts (dependencies include Reshuffled, NodeText, CsmElement, TextElement, PeekingIterator, DifferenceElementCalculator, CsmMix, DifferenceElement, MatchClassification), suggesting multiple responsibilities. Although lcom = 0.0, the combination of high LOC and WMC with few public operations and many dependencies justifies refactoring into smaller, more focused classes/methods."
