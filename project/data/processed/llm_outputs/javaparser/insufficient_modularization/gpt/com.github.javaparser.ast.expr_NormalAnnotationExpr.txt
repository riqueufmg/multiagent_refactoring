    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: 17 methods (all public) with only 1 field, LOC=99 and WMC=25 indicating substantial method complexity; LCOM=0.647 (reduced cohesion) suggests multiple responsibilities within the class; DIT=5 (deep inheritance) while still carrying many behaviors; dependencies count=13 (e.g. NodeList, MemberValuePair, Expression, Name, NameExpr, visitors, meta models) pointing to diverse responsibilities. These metrics together indicate the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
