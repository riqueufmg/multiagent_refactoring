    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: loc=16, nom=0, nof=1, wmc=0. It has no methods (nom=0), no public fields (nopf=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its minimal size and lack of internal structure or responsibilities to split, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
