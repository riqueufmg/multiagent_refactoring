    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.chunks.VarValidator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has few methods (nom=3, nopm=2) but a relatively large size (loc=73) and high cyclomatic complexity (wmc=17), which indicates complex logic concentrated in a small number of methods. There is only one field (nof=1, nopf=0) so behavior is embedded in methods rather than delegated, and the class depends on multiple external types (ProblemReporter, VarType, VariableDeclarationExpr), suggesting multiple responsibilities. These facts (loc=73, wmc=17, nom=3, nof=1, dependencies listed) justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and could be decomposed or have responsibilities extracted to reduce size and complexity."
