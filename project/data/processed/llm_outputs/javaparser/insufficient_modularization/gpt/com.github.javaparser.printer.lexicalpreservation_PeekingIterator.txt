        "Metrics do not indicate a class that is insufficiently modularized: LOC=139 and NOM=16 (moderate size), WMC=26 (moderate complexity), NOF=4 (small field set). LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion, and DIT=1 plus fanin/fanout=0 show low coupling. Although there are many public methods (NOPM=15), the high cohesion and moderate complexity/size suggest the class is not clearly a candidate for further decomposition."
