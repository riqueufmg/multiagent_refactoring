    "detection": true,
    "justification": "In isolation the class shows signs that further decomposition could reduce size and complexity: LOC = 91 (moderately large), WMC = 19 (high cyclomatic/implementation complexity), NOM = 8 with NOPM = 6 (many methods, several public), and NOF = 3 (multiple fields). Although LCOM = 0.25 indicates reasonable cohesion, the combined size (LOC) and complexity (WMC) together with multiple public methods suggest multiple responsibilities embedded in a single class. The presence of several external dependencies (4 listed) also implies the class interacts with different concerns. These elements justify detecting Insufficient Modularization and recommend considering splitting the class into smaller, focused classes or extracting responsibilities to reduce complexity."
