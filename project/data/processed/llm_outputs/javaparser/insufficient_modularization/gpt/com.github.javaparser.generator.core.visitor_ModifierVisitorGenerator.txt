    "justification": "The class appears small and cohesive when considered in isolation: LOC = 56 and NOM = 3 (NOPM = 1) indicate a limited surface and implementation size; WMC = 12 is moderate and not indicative of extreme complexity; LCOM = -1.0 implies high cohesion among members. DIT = 2 shows shallow inheritance depth, and fanin = 0 / fanout = 0 indicate little coupling to other modules. The listed dependencies are limited and domain-specific. These metrics do not support further decomposition for size or complexity reduction, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
