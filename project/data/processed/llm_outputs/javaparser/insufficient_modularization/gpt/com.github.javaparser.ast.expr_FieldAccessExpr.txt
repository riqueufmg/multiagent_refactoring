    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows multiple indicators of insufficient modularization: high method count (nom = 23) and size (loc = 163) combined with high complexity (wmc = 39) indicate the class implements many behaviors. Cohesion is moderate/low (lcom = 0.5217391304347826), suggesting the methods are not tightly related and the class likely has multiple responsibilities. The class has few fields (nof = 3) but many methods, which suggests behavior has not been decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The inheritance depth (dit = 4) and numerous dependencies further indicate complexity concentrated in this single class. Together these metrics justify that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
