    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization not detected: the class is small and cohesive (LOC=30, nom=7, nof=3), has low implementation complexity (WMC=7), very high cohesion (LCOM=0.0), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one external dependency (com.github.javaparser.ParserConfiguration). These metrics do not indicate an unduly large or complex class that would benefit from further decomposition."
