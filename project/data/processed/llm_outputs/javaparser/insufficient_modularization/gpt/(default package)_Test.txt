    "justification": "The class is very small and simple (LOC=9, NOM=1) with low complexity (WMC=1), no coupling (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0) and no cohesion warnings (LCOM=-1.0). Given the minimal size and complexity, there is no evidence the class has not been decomposed further or would benefit from additional modularization."
