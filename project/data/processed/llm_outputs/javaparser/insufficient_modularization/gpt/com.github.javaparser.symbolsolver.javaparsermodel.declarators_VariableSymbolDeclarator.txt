    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=19, WMC=3, NOM=2, NOF=0 and NOPF=0 indicate very few methods/fields to decompose. Coupling is minimal (fanout=0, fanin=0) and LCOM indicates cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). DIT=2 is shallow. Given these metrics and the provided dependencies, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized."
