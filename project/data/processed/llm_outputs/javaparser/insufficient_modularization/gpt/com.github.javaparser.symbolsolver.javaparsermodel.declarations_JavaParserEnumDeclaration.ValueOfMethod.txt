    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: it has only 2 fields (nof=2), zero methods (nom=0) and zero cyclomatic/behavioral complexity (wmc=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although its LOC is 79, the lack of methods and low complexity/coupling indicate it is not a large, monolithic unit that needs further decomposition. DIT=4 and the LCOM value are not by themselves sufficient to indicate decomposition need in isolation."
