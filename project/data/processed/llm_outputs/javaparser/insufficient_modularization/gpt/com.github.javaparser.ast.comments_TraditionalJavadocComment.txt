    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high method count (nom = 14, nopm = 14) concentrated in a small source size (loc = 52) with an overall complexity measure wmc = 14, indicating many distinct behaviors packed into a small class. There are no fields (nof = 0) and no external coupling reported (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), suggesting functionality is kept inside the class rather than decomposed into collaborating components. The deep inheritance depth (dit = 5) can further hide responsibilities in the hierarchy rather than through separate modules. The combination of many methods, relatively high complexity, and lack of decomposition points to Insufficient Modularization."
