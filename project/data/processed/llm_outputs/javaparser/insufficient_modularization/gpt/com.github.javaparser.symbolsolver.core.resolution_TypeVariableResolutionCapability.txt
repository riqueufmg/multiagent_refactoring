    "justification": "Class is very small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=3, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0, NOPM=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. These metrics indicate minimal implementation size and complexity; dependencies are limited to two types and do not indicate multiple responsibilities. Therefore there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
