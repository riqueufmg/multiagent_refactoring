    "justification": "The class is small and reasonably cohesive: LOC=34, NOM=7, WMC=9 (moderate complexity), LCOM=0.4286 (acceptable cohesion). It has only 1 field, DIT=1, and no reported fan-in/fan-out, indicating low coupling. Given the small size, moderate complexity and reasonable cohesion, there is no clear indication that further decomposition is needed."
