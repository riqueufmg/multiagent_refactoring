    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.NodeFinderVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is excessively large and behavior-rich: 102 methods (nom), 1,868 lines of code (loc) and a very high complexity (wmc = 648) indicate it combines many responsibilities. It depends on dozens of distinct AST node types (many entries in the dependencies list), which implies it implements logic for many different node kinds in one place. There are only 3 fields (nof = 3, nopf = 1) while the class exposes 102 methods, showing that behavior is centralized rather than delegated. Although LCOM is low (0.0196), the sheer number of methods, large LOC and high WMC demonstrate the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and could be modularized (e.g., split by node-family or responsibility) to reduce size and complexity."
