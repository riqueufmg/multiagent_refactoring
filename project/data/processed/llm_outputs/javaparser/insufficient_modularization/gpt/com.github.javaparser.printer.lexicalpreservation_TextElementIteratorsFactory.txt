    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.TextElementIteratorsFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 127 LOC with 9 fields but only 4 methods (high field-to-method ratio), indicating many data elements with limited behavior; LCOM = 0.5 shows only moderate/low cohesion among members; WMC = 7 with a small number of methods suggests concentrated complexity; the class depends on multiple element types (TextElement, ChildTextElement, NodeText, Provider) which implies multiple responsibilities. Together these metrics indicate the class is not fully decomposed and could be split to reduce size and complexity."
