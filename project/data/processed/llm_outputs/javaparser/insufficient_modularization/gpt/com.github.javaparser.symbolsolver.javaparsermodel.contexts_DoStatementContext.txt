    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: number of methods (nom) = 2, non-private methods (nopm) = 2, lines of code (loc) = 18, and weighted method count (wmc) = 3, which indicate low size and low complexity. Cohesion is high (lcom = -1.0). Coupling appears minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Although depth of inheritance (dit = 3) and listed dependencies exist, there is no evidence from these metrics that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
