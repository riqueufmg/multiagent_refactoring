    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.GenericVisitorAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of Insufficient Modularization: it defines a very large API surface (nom = 103 methods), is very large in size (loc = 1707), and has very high implementation complexity (wmc = 563). It directly depends on a wide range of distinct AST node types (examples: MethodDeclaration, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, IfStmt, ForStmt, SwitchStmt, LambdaExpr, ArrayType, PrimitiveType, CompilationUnit, EnumDeclaration, many others) which indicates it is handling many different responsibilities for many node kinds. The inheritance depth is shallow (dit = 1), so the complexity is concentrated in this class rather than being distributed via subclassing. Taken together (large LOC, high method count, high WMC, and many varied dependencies), these elements justify that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from further modularization (e.g., splitting into smaller visitor components or delegating responsibilities)."
