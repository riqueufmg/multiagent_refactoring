    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=12, WMC=3, 1 method (nom=1) and 1 field (nof=1). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, few external dependencies). These metrics indicate the class is already modular and does not show signs of insufficient modularization."
