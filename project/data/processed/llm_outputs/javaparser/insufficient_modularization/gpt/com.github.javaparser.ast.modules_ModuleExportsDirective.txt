    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.modules.ModuleExportsDirective",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high method count (nom = 22, nopm = 22) combined with moderate size (loc = 118) indicates many responsibilities bundled into one class; high complexity (wmc = 33) suggests implementation complexity that could be reduced by splitting responsibilities; low cohesion (lcom = 0.636) implies methods are not strongly related and the class likely mixes unrelated functionality; very few fields (nof = 2, nopf = 0) means many methods operate without shared state, a common symptom of a class that should be decomposed into smaller modules. These metrics together justify recommending further decomposition."
