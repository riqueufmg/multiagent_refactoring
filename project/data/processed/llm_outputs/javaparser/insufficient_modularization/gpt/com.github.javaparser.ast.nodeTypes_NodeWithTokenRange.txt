    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithTokenRange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=7, number of methods (nom)=2, weighted method count (wmc)=2, number of fields (nof)=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has only one dependency (com.github.javaparser.TokenRange). Cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) indicates no fragmentation. These metrics show no evidence of a large, complex class that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
