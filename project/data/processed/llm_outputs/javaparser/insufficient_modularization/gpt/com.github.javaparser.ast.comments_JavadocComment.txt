    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC = 36, NOM = 10, WMC = 10. It has no fields (NOF = 0) and shows high cohesion (LCOM = -1.0). Coupling metrics do not indicate wide external coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). The relatively deep inheritance (DIT = 4) suggests behavior is obtained via subclassing rather than by accumulating responsibilities in this class. Given the small size, moderate complexity, and strong cohesion, there is no evidence that this class requires further decomposition (i.e., no sign of insufficient modularization)."
