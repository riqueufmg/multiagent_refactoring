    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: loc=15, nom=4, wmc=4 (low complexity), lcom=-1.0 (high cohesion). There are no fields (nof=0), no inheritance depth (dit=0), and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its low size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
