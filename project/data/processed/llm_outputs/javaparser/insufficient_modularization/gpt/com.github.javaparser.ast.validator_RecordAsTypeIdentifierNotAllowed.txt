    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=28, NOM=4, WMC=7 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low complexity and high cohesion. It has a single field (nof=1), low public method count (nopm=3) and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not suggest it needs further decomposition."
