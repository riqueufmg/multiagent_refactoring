    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), very small size (loc=5) and zero complexity (wmc=0). Fan-in and fan-out are 0 and there are no dependencies, indicating trivial implementation with nothing to decompose. Although DIT=13 is high, in isolation it does not show internal size or complexity that would require further modularization. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
