    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.logic.ObjectProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No — the class is very small and simple: LOC=7, number of methods (nom)=2, WMC=2 (low complexity), number of constructors (nc)=1. Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0) and there are no coupling concerns (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics show no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
