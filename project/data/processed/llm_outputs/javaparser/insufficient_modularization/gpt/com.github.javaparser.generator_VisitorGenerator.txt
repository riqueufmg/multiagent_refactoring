    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: 45 LOC, 5 methods (nom=5) and 5 fields (nof=5) indicate limited size; WMC=9 and NC=15 show low-to-moderate complexity; LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. DIT=1 (shallow inheritance), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no wide coupling) and nopf=0 (no public fields) further indicate the class is already well scoped. Given these metrics and analyzing the class in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
