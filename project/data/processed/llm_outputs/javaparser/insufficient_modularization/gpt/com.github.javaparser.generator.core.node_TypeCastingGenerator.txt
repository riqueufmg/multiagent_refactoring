    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.node.TypeCastingGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no strong signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=60), modest method count (nom=6) and low number of fields (nof=1); overall complexity is moderate (wmc=10) and cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.333). It has no incoming/outgoing coupling observed (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics in isolation, there is insufficient evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
