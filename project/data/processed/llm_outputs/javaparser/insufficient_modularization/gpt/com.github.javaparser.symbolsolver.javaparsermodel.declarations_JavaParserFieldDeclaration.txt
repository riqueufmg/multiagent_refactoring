    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization. Evidence: small size (LOC=60), moderate complexity (WMC=15) and a limited number of fields (NOF=3). Although it has 12 methods (NOM=12), cohesion is high (LCOM=0.1667) indicating related responsibilities rather than a mixture of unrelated concerns. Coupling indicators are low (fanout=0, fanin=0), and there is no indication of excessive method complexity or sprawling code that would benefit from decomposition. These metrics together argue against further decomposition."
