    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: LOC=1, NOF=0, NOPF=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0, WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]. There are no fields or methods and no measurable complexity or coupling that would indicate the class needs further decomposition. LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion data) but given the absence of members, there is no evidence of excessive size or responsibility to justify refactoring."
