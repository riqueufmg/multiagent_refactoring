    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=44, WMC=5, NOM=4 (NOPM=2) and NOF=1 indicate limited size and responsibilities. LCOM=0.0 shows high cohesion. Fanout=0 and Fanin=0 indicate few coupling concerns. DIT=1 and NC=0 show simple inheritance/use. Given these metrics, there is no evidence the class is insufficiently modularized or that it needs further decomposition."
