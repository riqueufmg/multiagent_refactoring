        "High number of methods: nom = 15 (nopm = 15) — large public API surface for a single class suggests multiple responsibilities that could be split.",
        "Moderate size and complexity: loc = 111 and WMC = 24 — overall implementation complexity concentrated in one class, indicating opportunity to decompose to reduce complexity.",
        "Low cohesion: LCOM = 0.9333333333333332 (close to 1) — methods are weakly related, a strong indicator that the class bundles unrelated behaviors and could be modularized.",
        "Structural indicators: single class file (nof = 1) with deep inheritance (DIT = 5) and dependencies on visitors/metamodel/TokenRange/LineSeparator — the class likely mixes concerns (API, visiting, metamodel handling, token/formatting aspects) and would benefit from decomposition."
