    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.declarations.JavaParserEnumDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows indicators of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 341), many methods (NOM = 35, NOPM = 34), and high implementation complexity (WMC = 56). It also has a non-trivial number of fields (NOF = 9) and a deep inheritance level (DIT = 5), increasing maintenance complexity. The class depends on many external types (21 dependencies), suggesting multiple responsibilities or interactions. Although cohesion (LCOM = 0.2286) is reasonably low, the combination of high LOC, high method count, and high WMC indicates the class has not been fully decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and complexity."
