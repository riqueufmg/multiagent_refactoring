    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=15, NOF=1, NOM=0, WMC=0, NC=0. It has no methods (NOM=0), no measurable complexity (WMC=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]), and low overall size. These characteristics indicate there is no evidence that the class has failed to be decomposed further; insufficient modularization is not detected."
