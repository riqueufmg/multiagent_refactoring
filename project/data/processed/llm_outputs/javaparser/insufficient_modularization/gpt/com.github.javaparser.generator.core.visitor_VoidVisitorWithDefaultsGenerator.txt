    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=14, NOM=2 (NOPM=1), WMC=2. Low size and low complexity indicate no need for further decomposition. LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 show no coupling pressure requiring modularization. DIT=2 is modest. Based on these metrics the class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
