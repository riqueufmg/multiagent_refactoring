    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=26, number of methods=5, number of fields=1. Complexity is low-to-moderate (WMC=7) and cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). It has no fan-in/fan-out reported and a shallow inheritance depth (DIT=2). Given its limited size, method count and high cohesion, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition — insufficient modularization is not detected."
