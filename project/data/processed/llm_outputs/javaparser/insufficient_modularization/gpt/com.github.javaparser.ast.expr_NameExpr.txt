    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.NameExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a high number of methods (nom = 16) relative to a single field (nof = 1), high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc = 20), and low cohesion (lcom = 0.6875) which indicates methods are not tightly related. loc = 85 with 16 methods concentrates substantial behavior in one class. A deep inheritance depth (dit = 4) can compound mixed responsibilities. The variety of external dependencies (several metamodel, visitor, resolution, node and name-related types) also suggests multiple concerns are being handled. Taken in isolation, these metrics indicate the class should likely be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive units."
