    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization not detected: the class is very small (loc=5), has a single method (nom=1, nopm=1), very low implementation complexity (wmc=1), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies, and cohesion metric indicates cohesion (lcom=-1.0). These metrics do not indicate the class should be further decomposed."
