    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is trivial and does not show signs of being insufficiently modularized: loc=3 (very small), nom=0 and nof=0 (no methods or fields to decompose), wmc=0 (no complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 and dependencies=[] (no coupling to justify further decomposition). lcom=-1.0 is not indicative of a large undivided responsibility here. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
