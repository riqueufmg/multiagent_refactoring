    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.IfStatementContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=121 (large size), WMC=24 (high cyclomatic/implementation complexity), NOM=7 (multiple methods with high combined complexity), DIT=3 (non-trivial inheritance depth). Dependencies indicate mixed responsibilities (uses NormalCompletionVisitor, PatternVariableVisitor, PatternVariableResult, TypeSolver, IfStmt, Expression, Node), suggesting the class handles AST-specific logic, visitor/completion logic and pattern-variable resolution in one place. These metrics and diverse dependency set indicate the class could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
