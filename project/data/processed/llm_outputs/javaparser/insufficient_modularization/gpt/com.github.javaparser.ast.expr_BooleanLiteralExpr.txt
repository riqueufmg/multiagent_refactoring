    "justification": "Presence of 14 methods (nom=14) in a small source (loc=62) with moderate complexity (wmc=15) indicates the class contains substantial behavior for its size. Low cohesion (lcom=0.714) shows methods are not strongly related to shared state, suggesting multiple responsibilities. There is only 1 field (nof=1, nopf=0), so many methods operate without common instance data, which is a strong sign that functionality can be decomposed. The deep inheritance depth (dit=5) combined with these factors increases the likelihood that further modularization (splitting responsibilities into separate classes/components) would reduce size and implementation complexity."
