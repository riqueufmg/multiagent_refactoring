    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modular: 19 methods (nom = 19) with 12 public methods (nopm = 12) and 145 lines of code (loc = 145) indicate a large implementation surface. Its weighted method count (wmc = 38) signals high internal complexity that could be reduced by splitting responsibilities. The class also depends on many external types (multiple resolution/AST-related dependencies), suggesting it handles several concerns. Although LCOM is low (0.105) indicating acceptable cohesion, the combination of high method count, high complexity (WMC), many public methods, and moderate LOC supports refactoring into smaller, focused classes or helper components to reduce size and implementation complexity."
