    "justification": "Class is small and not a clear candidate for further decomposition: LOC=40, NOM=8 and WMC=8 indicate modest size/complexity. Although LCOM=0.625 shows only moderate cohesion, the overall footprint is small and does not strongly indicate multiple independent responsibilities. Additionally fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no wide coupling that would necessitate splitting. On balance, the metrics do not justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
