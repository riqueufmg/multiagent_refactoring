    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.ConstraintFormulaSet",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and does not exhibit signs that further decomposition is warranted: LOC=36, number of methods (nom)=5, number of fields (nof)=2, weighted method count (wmc)=6. Cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.4). There are no inbound/outbound coupling concerns in the given data (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no public fields (nopf=0). Given these metrics and analyzing the class in isolation, there is insufficient evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity to justify Insufficient Modularization."
