    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.LambdaExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high method count (nom=26, nopm=26) combined with high complexity (wmc=39) while having a moderate size (loc=158) indicates many responsibilities or complex methods packed into one class. It uses many distinct dependency types (NodeList, BlockStmt, Statement, Parameter, Expression, Node, TokenRange, Range, visitor and metamodel types), suggesting it handles multiple concerns (parameters, body/statements, tokens, visitors, metadata). Although it has few fields (nof=3), cohesion is only moderate (lcom=0.423), which does not offset the high complexity and number of public methods. The inheritance depth (dit=4) further increases implementation complexity. Together these metrics justify that the class would likely benefit from further decomposition."
