    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=17), few methods (nom=3), low complexity (WMC=3), no incoming/outgoing coupling reported (fanin=0, fanout=0), shallow inheritance (DIT=0) and high cohesion indicator (LCOM=-1.0). These values suggest the class is already small and cohesive and does not require further decomposition."
