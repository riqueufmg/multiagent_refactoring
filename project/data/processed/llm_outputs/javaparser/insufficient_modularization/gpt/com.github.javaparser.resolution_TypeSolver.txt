    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small (loc=62) with a moderate number of methods (nom=10) and moderate complexity (wmc=13). Cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0) and coupling appears low (fanin=0, fanout=0, only 3 external dependencies). It has a small number of fields (nof=2) and no inheritance (dit=0). Given the compact size, good cohesion, and low coupling, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
