    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.JavaParserFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large and complex but has very few methods: LOC=156 and WMC=49 while NOM=2 (average complexity per method ≈24.5). This indicates very long/highly complex method implementations rather than smaller decomposed units. The dependency list (ForStmt, ForEachStmt, ExpressionStmt, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, TypeSolver, Navigator, Context, SymbolDeclarator, Node) shows it handles varied AST nodes and resolution concerns, suggesting multiple responsibilities. The combination of high size/complexity and low method count is a clear sign of insufficient modularization and that further decomposition (into smaller methods or classes) would reduce complexity."
