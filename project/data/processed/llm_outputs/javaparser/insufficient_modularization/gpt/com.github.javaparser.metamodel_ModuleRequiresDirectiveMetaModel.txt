    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=10, 1 method (nom=1), 2 fields (nof=2) and low complexity (WMC=1). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on PropertyMetaModel). No indicators of a large or complex class that should be further decomposed; inheritance depth (DIT=3) alone does not justify decomposition."
