    "class": "com.github.javaparser.Token",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit clear signs of Insufficient Modularization: LOC is small (82) and WMC is low (7), indicating limited implementation complexity. Number of methods is modest (nom=7), and depth of inheritance is shallow (dit=1). Although LCOM=0.571 suggests only moderate cohesion and there are 9 fields (8 public) which raises encapsulation concerns, these do not, in isolation, demonstrate that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition. Fanin and fanout are 0, showing no coupling evidence that would motivate splitting the class. Therefore, based on the provided metrics in isolation, insufficient modularization is not detected."
