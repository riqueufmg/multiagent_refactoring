    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=7, NOM=2, WMC=2, single field (NOF=1). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has only two methods, so there is little implementation to decompose further. Although LCOM=1.0 indicates low cohesion, given the very small size and low complexity, further modularization is not justified based on the provided metrics and dependencies."
