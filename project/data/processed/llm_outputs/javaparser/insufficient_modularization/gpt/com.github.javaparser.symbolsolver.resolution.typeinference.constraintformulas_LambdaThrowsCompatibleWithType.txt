    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and focused: LOC=26, NOM=4, WMC=7 and NOF=2 indicate limited size and moderate complexity. LCOM=0.5 shows no strong lack of cohesion. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 indicate no broad coupling to split off responsibilities. Given these metrics, there is no evidence the class is insufficiently modular or requires further decomposition."
