    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=30, NOM=4, NOF=3. Complexity is moderate but not excessive (WMC=7). High cohesion (LCOM=0.0) and no coupling indications (fanin=0, fanout=0). There are no nested types (NC=0). Although DIT=4, the class size, method count and cohesion do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large or complex class, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
