    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.DotPrinter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: LOC = 55 (moderate size), NOM = 5 with NOPM = 3 (small number of methods), WMC = 13 (overall complexity is modest for 5 methods), NOF = 2 (few fields), LCOM = 0.0 (high cohesion). Fan-in/fan-out are 0 in the provided data and there are only 4 external dependencies. Given the small method count, moderate LOC and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
