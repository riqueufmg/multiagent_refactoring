    "class": "com.github.javaparser.javasymbolsolver.javassist_symbols.main_jar.SubInterfaceIncludedJar",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=3, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), a single field (nof=1, nopf=1), and zero complexity (wmc=0). It has no inheritance depth (dit=0) and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not show the size or complexity that would justify further decomposition (LCOM=-1.0 is not indicative of insufficient modularization here)."
