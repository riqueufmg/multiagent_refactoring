    "justification": "The class is small and non-complex: loc=9, nom=0, wmc=0, nc=0. It contains only nof=3 fields and no methods, has no dependencies (dependencies=[]), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate a simple data holder with low complexity and no behavioral responsibilities, so there is no evidence that it has not been decomposed further; insufficient modularization is not detected."
