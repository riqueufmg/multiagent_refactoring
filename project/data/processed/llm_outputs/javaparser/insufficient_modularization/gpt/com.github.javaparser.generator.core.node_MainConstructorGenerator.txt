    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=27, NOM=2, WMC=5. It shows high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0) and no external coupling (fanout=0, fanin=0). Given its minimal size and low complexity, there is no evidence it has not been decomposed further or that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
