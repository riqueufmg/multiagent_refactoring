    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a clear need for further decomposition: LOC = 99 (moderate size), NOM = 10 and WMC = 22 (method count and complexity are not excessively high), DIT = 0 (no deep inheritance suggesting a large multi-responsibility hierarchy), LCOM = -1.0 (no evidence of low cohesion). Dependencies are focused (NodeList, VariableDeclarator, Type) and the presence of an internal Helper suggests some internal decomposition. These elements together do not justify marking this class as exhibiting Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
