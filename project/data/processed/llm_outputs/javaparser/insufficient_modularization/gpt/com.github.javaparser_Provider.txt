    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=14, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no fields or multiple methods suggesting multiple responsibilities. Although LCOM is -1.0 (unavailable/undefined), the low size and complexity metrics show no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
