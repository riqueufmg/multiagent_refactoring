    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.TextElementIteratorsFactory.SingleElementIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: loc=16, nof=2, nom=0, wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]. With zero methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0) and only 2 fields, there is no evidence that the class is large or monolithic and would benefit from further decomposition."
