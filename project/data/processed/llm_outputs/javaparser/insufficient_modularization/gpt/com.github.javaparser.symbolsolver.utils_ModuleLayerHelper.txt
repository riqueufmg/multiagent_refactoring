    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.utils.ModuleLayerHelper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2), small size (loc=45) and modest complexity (wmc=6). It has no incoming or outgoing coupling recorded (fanin=0, fanout=0) and an LCOM value indicating cohesion (lcom=-1.0). Given the low method count, small LOC and limited complexity, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
