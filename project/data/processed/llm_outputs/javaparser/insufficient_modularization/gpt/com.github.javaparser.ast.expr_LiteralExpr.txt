    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: loc=34, nom=8, wmc=8 indicate low size and complexity. LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion. No fields (nof=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although DIT=4, there is no evidence of excessive responsibility or method bloat that would warrant further decomposition. Dependencies are limited to 4 external types. These metrics do not support Insufficient Modularization."
