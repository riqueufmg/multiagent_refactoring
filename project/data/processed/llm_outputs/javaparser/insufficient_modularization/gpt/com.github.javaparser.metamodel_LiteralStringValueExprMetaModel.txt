    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected. The class is small and simple (loc=12, nom=2, nof=1) with low implementation complexity (wmc=2). Coupling indicators are minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=1), so there is no evidence of a large, monolithic implementation that would benefit from further decomposition. Although LCOM=1.0 indicates low cohesion and DIT=4 shows a deep inheritance level, taken in isolation the low size and complexity metrics do not justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
