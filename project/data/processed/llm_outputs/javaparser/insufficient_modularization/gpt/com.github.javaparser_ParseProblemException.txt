    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=26, NOM=4 (NOPM=3), WMC=5, and only 1 field (NOF=1). Coupling is minimal (FANOUT=0, only dependency: com.github.javaparser.utils.LineSeparator). Cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.5) but not extreme, inheritance depth is 0 (DIT=0) and it has no children (NC=0). Given the low size, low complexity and minimal coupling in isolation, there is no strong evidence that this class needs further decomposition."
