    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.RemovedGroup",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has a non-trivial size (loc=165) and moderate complexity (wmc=33) with a fair number of methods (nom=16) and fields (nof=8), its cohesion is high (lcom=0.1875) and it exposes a small public surface (nopm=4). These metrics indicate the code is focused and internally related rather than being a monolithic, multi-responsibility class that clearly warrants further decomposition. Therefore, based on the provided isolated metrics, this class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
