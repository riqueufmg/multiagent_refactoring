    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=8, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0, NOPF=0. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0) and no listed dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 and a single method indicate cohesion is not a problem. Given these metrics, there is no evidence the class has insufficient modularization or requires further decomposition."
