    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=10, NOM=5 and WMC=5 (complexity proportional to method count), LCOM=-1.0 (indicates high cohesion). It has no incoming or outgoing usage (fanin=0, fanout=0) beyond a single dependency on ConfigurationOption. Given its low size, moderate complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that it needs further decomposition; thus Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
