    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: LOC = 35 (small size), WMC = 0 and NOM = 0 (no internal method complexity or multiple methods to split), NOPF = 0 (no fields), fan-in = 0 and fan-out = 0 (no coupling indicating hidden responsibilities), LCOM = -1.0 (not applicable). In isolation these values show no internal complexity or multiple responsibilities that would justify further modularization."
