    "justification": "Class is very small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC = 3, NOM = 0 (no methods), WMC = 0 (no complexity), NOF = 1 (single field). Coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). There is no evidence of high implementation complexity or size that would indicate Insufficient Modularization; given these metrics the class is already minimal/atomic."
