    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithMembers",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large interface and implementation size (nom = 37 methods, loc = 309) with a weighted methods complexity wmc = 37, indicating substantial implementation surface. Its dependency list spans many distinct member-related types (FieldDeclaration, MethodDeclaration, ConstructorDeclaration, InitializerDeclaration, VariableDeclarator, BodyDeclaration, etc.), which implies it handles multiple member-specific responsibilities. Although LCOM = -1.0 suggests cohesion, the high method count and the variety of member-related dependencies indicate the class bundles several concerns that could be split into smaller, focused components to reduce size and implementation complexity, so insufficient modularization is detected."
