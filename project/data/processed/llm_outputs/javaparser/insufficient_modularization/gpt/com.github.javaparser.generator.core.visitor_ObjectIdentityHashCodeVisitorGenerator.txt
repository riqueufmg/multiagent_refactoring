    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.visitor.ObjectIdentityHashCodeVisitorGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=14, number of methods (nom)=2, weighted method count (wmc)=2. It has no fields (nof=0) and minimal internal complexity (nopm=1). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0). Depth of inheritance (dit=2) is modest and does not by itself indicate insufficient decomposition. These metrics indicate the class does not require further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
