    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has a non‑trivial size (loc = 117) and 4 fields (nof = 4), other indicators do not suggest an undivided, complex implementation: it has no methods reported (nom = 0), zero weighted method complexity (wmc = 0), no inbound/outbound coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and no method-level complexity to decompose. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no clear evidence of insufficient modularization."
