    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=34, NOM=3, WMC=3 indicate low size and low complexity. LCOM=0.0 shows high cohesion. It has no public fields (NOPF=0), only one public method (NOPM=1), and minimal coupling (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0). DIT=0 (no inheritance complexity). Given these metrics and the single external dependency (com.github.javaparser.ParserConfiguration), there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or that it requires further decomposition."
