    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=10, wmc=1, nom=1 (nopm=1). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single external dependency). Number of fields (nof=3) does not, by itself, indicate an undecomposed class given the very low method count and complexity. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization when the class is considered in isolation."
