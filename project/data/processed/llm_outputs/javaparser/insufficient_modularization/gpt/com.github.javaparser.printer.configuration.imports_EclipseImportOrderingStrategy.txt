    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=49, #methods=3 (nopm=3), #fields=1, LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). Complexity is moderate (WMC=10) but concentrated in only 3 methods, and there are no incoming/outgoing coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the low size, high cohesion, and lack of coupling, there is no strong evidence that further decomposition is needed."
