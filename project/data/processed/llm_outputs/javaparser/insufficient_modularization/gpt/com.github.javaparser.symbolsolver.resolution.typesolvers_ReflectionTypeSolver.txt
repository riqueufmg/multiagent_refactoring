    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=50, WMC=5, NOM=4 and NOF=4 (NOPM=3, NOPF=3), indicating limited size and complexity. Fan-in and Fan-out are 0, and it has only two external dependencies, so it does not act as a large coupling hub. DIT=2 and NC=0 do not imply an extensive inheritance-based responsibility that needs splitting. Although LCOM=0.75 suggests only moderate cohesion, the overall low method count, low complexity and small size do not justify further decomposition in isolation."
