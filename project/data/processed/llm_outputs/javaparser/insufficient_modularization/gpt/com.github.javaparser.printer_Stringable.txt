    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=6, NOM=1, WMC=1. It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and therefore contains a single, cohesive responsibility that cannot reasonably be decomposed further. These metrics indicate insufficient size/complexity to warrant further modularization."
