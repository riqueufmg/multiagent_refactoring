    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.visitor.VoidVisitorAdapterGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: it is small (LOC=30), has few methods (nom=2, nopm=1), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Cyclomatic/implementation complexity is moderate but limited (wmc=7) and depth of inheritance (DIT=2) is small. Cohesion indicator is not signaling a problem (lcom=-1.0). Given the size, method count, absence of fields, and low coupling, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
