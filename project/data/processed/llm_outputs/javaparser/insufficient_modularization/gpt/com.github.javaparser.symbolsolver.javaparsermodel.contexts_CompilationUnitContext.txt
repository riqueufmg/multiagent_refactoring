    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.CompilationUnitContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC=241) and high implementation complexity (WMC=65) with many methods (NOM=15, NOPM=5). Cohesion is only moderate (LCOM=0.4), suggesting multiple responsibilities. It has few fields (NOF=2) but many behavioral elements, which often indicates procedural aggregation rather than well-scoped objects. The class depends on a wide set of distinct concerns (e.g. ClassOrInterfaceType, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, TypeSolver, JavaParserFacade, MethodDeclaration, SymbolReference, Name, ResolvedTypeDeclaration, SymbolSolver, MethodResolutionLogic, Node, CompilationUnit), implying it handles type resolution, method resolution and AST/node interactions simultaneously. Taken in isolation, these metrics and dependency diversity justify that the class is a candidate for decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
