    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high method count (nom = 15) and relatively high complexity (wmc = 20) while having very few fields (nof = 2, nopf = 2) suggests many methods operate independently rather than on shared state. Low cohesion (lcom = 0.9333333333333332) supports that the class groups multiple responsibilities. Moderate size (loc = 89) combined with deep inheritance (dit = 6) and multiple external dependencies also indicate potential separation of concerns. These metrics together justify that the class could be further decomposed into smaller, more cohesive components."
