    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is minimal and does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: LOC=1, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]. There are no fields, methods, or measurable complexity to justify further decomposition; the class size and lack of responsibilities argue against the smell."
