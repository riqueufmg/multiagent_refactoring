    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.Parameter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 221) and high method complexity (WMC = 55) together with a substantial number of methods (NOM = 26) indicate concentrated implementation complexity that could be split. The class has a moderate number of fields (NOF = 6) but only moderate cohesion (LCOM = 0.3076923076923077), suggesting multiple responsibilities or distinct behaviors within one class. A non-trivial inheritance depth (DIT = 3) and numerous external dependencies further increase complexity. These elements together justify that further decomposition (extracting responsibilities or helper classes) would likely reduce size and implementation complexity."
