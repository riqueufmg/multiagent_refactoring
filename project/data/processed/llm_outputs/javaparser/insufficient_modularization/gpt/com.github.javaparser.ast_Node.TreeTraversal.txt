    "justification": "Metrics show the class is trivial: LOC=1, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, NC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no methods, fields, or dependencies indicating a large or complex implementation that requires further decomposition. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization for this class."
