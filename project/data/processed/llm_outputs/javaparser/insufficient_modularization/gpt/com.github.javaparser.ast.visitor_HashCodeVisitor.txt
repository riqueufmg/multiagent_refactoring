    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.HashCodeVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very high method count (nom = 105) with almost all methods public (nopm = 104) indicating a huge public surface and many responsibilities; high complexity (wmc = 106) and substantial size (loc = 324) which suggest heavy implementation burden; LCOM = 1.0 consistent with low cohesion across methods; and the dependency list includes a large number of distinct AST node/types (many visit targets), implying the class handles many different concerns. Together these metrics indicate the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
