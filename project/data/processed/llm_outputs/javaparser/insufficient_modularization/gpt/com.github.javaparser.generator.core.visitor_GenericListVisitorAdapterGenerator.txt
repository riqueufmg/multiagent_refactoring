    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=29, NOM=2, WMC=5 indicate low size and complexity; LCOM=-1.0 suggests good cohesion; FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 show limited coupling; only a few external dependencies are used. Based on these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
