    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: LOC = 127 (relatively large), WMC = 26 (high cyclomatic/implementation complexity), NOM = 18 (many methods), LCOM = 0.5556 (moderate/low cohesion indicating mixed responsibilities), DIT = 4 (deep inheritance adding complexity). Together these metrics suggest the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
