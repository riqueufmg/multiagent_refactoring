    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.CastExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: a relatively high method count (nom = 16) with all methods public (nopm = 16) and only 2 fields (nof = 2) suggests many behaviors operating on little state (too many responsibilities in one class). Complexity is high (wmc = 23) while size is non-trivial (loc = 89). Cohesion is moderate/low (lcom = 0.625), indicating the methods are not highly related and could be grouped into smaller, more focused units. A deep inheritance depth (dit = 4) increases conceptual complexity, and the variety of dependencies (Expression, Type, Node, visitor types, TokenRange, ObservableProperty, metamodel classes) suggests multiple concerns (type handling, visitor support, token/positioning, observation) are combined. Together these metrics justify that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
