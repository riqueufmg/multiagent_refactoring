    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.BaseNodeMetaModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high size (loc = 168), high complexity (wmc = 33), and a large number of methods (nom = 21, nopm = 21). It also declares a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 9). These values indicate multiple responsibilities and implementation complexity that could be reduced by decomposing the class. Although cohesion is relatively good (lcom = 0.1428571428571428), the combination of LOC, WMC and many public methods suggests the class would benefit from further decomposition. Additional indicators: dit = 0 (no inheritance decomposition) and limited external dependencies (listed dependencies = 3) imply responsibilities are concentrated inside this single class rather than delegated."
