    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=32, WMC=0, NOM=0. It has a modest number of fields (NOF=5) but no methods (NOM=0) and no measured coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). LCOM=-1 (no methods) does not indicate cohesion problems. There is no metric evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would suggest it should be further decomposed."
