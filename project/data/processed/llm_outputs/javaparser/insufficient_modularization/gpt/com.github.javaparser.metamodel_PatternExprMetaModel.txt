    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: loc=12, nom=2, wmc=2, nof=1, nc=2, fanin=0, fanout=0. The class is small with very low complexity and no external coupling, so there is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity requiring modularization. Although LCOM=1.0 suggests low cohesion, given the very small size (2 methods, 1 field) this is not strong evidence of insufficient modularization in isolation."
