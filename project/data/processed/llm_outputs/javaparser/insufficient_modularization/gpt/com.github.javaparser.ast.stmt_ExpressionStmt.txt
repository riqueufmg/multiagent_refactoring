    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.ExpressionStmt",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high lack of cohesion (LCOM = 0.714) while having many methods (NOM = 14) but very few fields (NOF = 1) — indicating many methods do not share common state. Complexity is relatively high (WMC = 18) for a small-to-moderate size (LOC = 69). Depth of inheritance (DIT = 4) adds to implementation complexity. The dependency list (visitor interfaces, ObservableProperty, TokenRange, Expression, metamodel classes) indicates the class is承担ing multiple responsibilities (node/visitor/observable/token/expression concerns). Together these metrics justify that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
