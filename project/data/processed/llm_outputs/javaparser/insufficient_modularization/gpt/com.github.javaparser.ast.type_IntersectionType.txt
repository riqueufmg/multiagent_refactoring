    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.IntersectionType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: a high method count (nom=18, nopm=18) and relatively high complexity (wmc=26) for a small source size (loc=92). It has only one field (nof=1) yet many methods operating on little state, and a moderate cohesion score (lcom=0.6667), which suggests multiple responsibilities or clusters of behavior inside the same class. These indicators (many public methods, high WMC, few fields, and reduced cohesion) justify that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
