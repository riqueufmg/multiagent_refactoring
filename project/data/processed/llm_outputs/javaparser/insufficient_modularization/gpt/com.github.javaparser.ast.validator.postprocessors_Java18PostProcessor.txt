    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being too large or complex and therefore does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization. Metrics: LOC=5, NOF=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0, WMC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no fields or methods to decompose; overall size and complexity are minimal. (DIT=9 is noted but, in isolation, depth of inheritance without internal implementation does not indicate a need for further decomposition.)"
