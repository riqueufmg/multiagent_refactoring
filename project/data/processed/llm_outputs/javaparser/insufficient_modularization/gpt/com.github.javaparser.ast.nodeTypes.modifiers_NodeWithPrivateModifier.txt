    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has only 2 methods (nom=2), 11 lines of code (loc=11), and low cyclomatic/weighted method count (wmc=2). It has minimal inheritance depth (dit=1), a single child count (nc=1), and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate a small, low-complexity class that does not exhibit the size or implementation complexity characteristic of Insufficient Modularization."
