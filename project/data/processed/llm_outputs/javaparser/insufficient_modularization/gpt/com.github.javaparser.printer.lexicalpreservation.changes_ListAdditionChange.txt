    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=35, NOM=3 (3 methods), WMC=6 (low/ moderate complexity), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). It has few fields (NOF=3) and no reported coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its small size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that it has not been completely decomposed or that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
