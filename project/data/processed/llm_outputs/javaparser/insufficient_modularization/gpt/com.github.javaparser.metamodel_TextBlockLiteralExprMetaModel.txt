    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=8, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0. It has no fields, no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no dependencies. These indicators show low size and low implementation complexity, so there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
