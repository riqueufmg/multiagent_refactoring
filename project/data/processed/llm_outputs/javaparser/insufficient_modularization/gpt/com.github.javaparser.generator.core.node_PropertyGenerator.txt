    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class size and complexity (LOC=118, WMC=23) are high for a single class with only 6 methods (NOM=6), indicating substantial per-method complexity. Cohesion is only moderate (LCOM=0.333), implying multiple responsibilities. The class has multiple fields (NOF=2) and interacts with a wide variety of unrelated dependencies (CompilationUnit, EnumDeclaration, BlockStmt, CodeUtils, JavaParserMetaModel, PropertyMetaModel, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, StaticJavaParser, BaseNodeMetaModel, SourceRoot, MethodDeclaration, Utils), suggesting mixed concerns. Taken in isolation, these factors indicate the class is insufficiently modular and would likely benefit from decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
