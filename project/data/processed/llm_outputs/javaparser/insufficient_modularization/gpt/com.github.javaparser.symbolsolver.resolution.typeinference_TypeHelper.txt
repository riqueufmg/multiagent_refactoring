    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.TypeHelper",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High implementation complexity and multiple responsibilities: WMC = 45 and LOC = 196 indicate the class contains complex and/or large methods; NOM = 14 with NOPM = 13 shows most methods are public, increasing the class's surface area. The class is stateless (NOF = 0) yet depends on a wide range of concepts (dependencies include ResolvedWildcard, FunctionalInterfaceLogic, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, TypeSolver, MethodType, ResolvedReferenceType, JavaParserFacade, Pair, ReferenceTypeImpl, SymbolReference, ResolvedType, ResolvedPrimitiveType, Expression, LeastUpperBoundLogic, LambdaExpr), which suggests it handles diverse concerns (wildcards, functional interfaces/lambdas, reference and primitive types, least-upper-bound logic, method type inference, facade interactions). These indicators (high WMC, many public methods, and many unrelated dependencies) support that the class is insufficiently modularized and could be decomposed into smaller, focused classes (e.g., separate helpers for wildcard handling, lambda/functional interface logic, LUB calculation, primitive/reference type handling, and method type inference)."
