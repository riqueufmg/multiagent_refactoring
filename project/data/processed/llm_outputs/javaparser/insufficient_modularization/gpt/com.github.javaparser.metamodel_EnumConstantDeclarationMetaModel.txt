    "justification": "Class is small and simple when considered in isolation: LOC=11, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=3. Low complexity (WMC=1), low size (LOC=11), single method (NOM=1), and high cohesion (LCOM=0.0) indicate it is already well-scoped. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on PropertyMetaModel), so there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
