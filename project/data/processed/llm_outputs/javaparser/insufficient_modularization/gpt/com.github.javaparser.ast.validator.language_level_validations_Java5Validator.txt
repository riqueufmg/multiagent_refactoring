    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java5Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small and simple (loc=46), has only one method (nom=1, nopm=1) and very low complexity (wmc=1). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0), coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0), and it has a small number of fields (nof=4) used within a single responsibility. These elements indicate the class is already well-focused and does not require further decomposition."
