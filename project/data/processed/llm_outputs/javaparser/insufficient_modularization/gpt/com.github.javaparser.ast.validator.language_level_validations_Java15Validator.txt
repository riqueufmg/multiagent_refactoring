    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=10, NOM=1 (NOPM=1), WMC=1. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a single responsibility (one method), so there is no evidence it has not been decomposed. LCOM=-1.0 (no cohesion concern for a single-method class). Although DIT=18 is high, the class itself is minimal in size and complexity, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
