    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistParameterDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has 10 methods (nom = 10) and all are public (nopm = 10), the overall size and complexity are modest: LOC = 42 and WMC = 10 (moderate complexity). Cohesion is acceptable (LCOM = 0.4) and coupling indicators are low (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). The deep inheritance (DIT = 4) does not by itself indicate that this single class should be further decomposed. Taken in isolation, the metrics do not provide strong evidence that the class has insufficient modularization."
