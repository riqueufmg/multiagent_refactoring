    "justification": "Class is minimal and contains no functionality that would benefit from decomposition: loc=2, nom=0, nopm=0, nopf=0, wmc=0. There are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no methods or fields to split. LCOM=-1.0 indicates lack of meaningful cohesion data (no members). Given these metrics the class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization."
