    "justification": "Class is trivial and does not exhibit insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=2), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no dependencies. These metrics indicate there is nothing to further decompose; the class is already minimal."
