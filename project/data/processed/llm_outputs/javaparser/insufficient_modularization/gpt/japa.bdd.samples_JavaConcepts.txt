    "justification": "LOC=299 (large class size), NOF=29 (many fields) vs NOM=9 (few methods) indicating a data-heavy class with limited behavior per field, LCOM=0.8888888889 (high lack of cohesion) showing methods do not share common state, WMC=23 (moderate complexity) and presence of nested/dependent types (japa.bdd.samples.JavaConcepts.A, .QWE) — together these indicate the class groups multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
