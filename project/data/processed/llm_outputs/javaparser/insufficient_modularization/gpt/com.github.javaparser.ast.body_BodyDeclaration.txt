    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.BodyDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows multiple signs of Insufficient Modularization: very high number of methods (nom=62, nopm=61) combined with only one field (nof=1) indicates many behaviors not tied to shared state; high complexity (wmc=70) and moderate size (loc=211) suggest heavy implementation burden; low cohesion (lcom=0.919) means methods are not strongly related and could form separate units; it depends on many different types (≈21 listed dependencies) implying multiple responsibilities. Taken in isolation, these metrics indicate the class is a candidate for further decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
