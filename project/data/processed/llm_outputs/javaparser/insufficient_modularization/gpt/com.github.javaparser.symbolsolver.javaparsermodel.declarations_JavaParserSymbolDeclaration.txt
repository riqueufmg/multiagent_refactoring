    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and not sufficiently complex to indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=32, NOM=6 (NOPM=5), WMC=9. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show low coupling; dependencies are limited but do not imply many responsibilities. Given the low size and moderate complexity, there is no clear evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
