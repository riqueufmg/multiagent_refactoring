    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity (LOC=30, WMC=4, NOM=4) with no fields (NOF=0) and only 2 public methods (NOPM=2). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion indicator is favorable (LCOM=-1.0). Given its small size, low complexity, high cohesion and lack of internal state, there is no evidence that it has not been sufficiently decomposed or that further decomposition would reduce size/complexity."
