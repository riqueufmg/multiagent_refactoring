    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java6Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=8), single method (NOM=1, NOPM=1), very low complexity (WMC=1), minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and high cohesion indicator (LCOM=-1.0). Although DIT=9 indicates deep inheritance, in isolation this does not indicate the class itself is large or should be further decomposed. Therefore no insufficient modularization detected."
