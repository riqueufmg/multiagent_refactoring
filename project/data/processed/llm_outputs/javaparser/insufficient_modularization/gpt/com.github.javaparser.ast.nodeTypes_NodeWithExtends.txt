    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithExtends",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and self-contained: LOC = 52 and WMC = 10 indicate limited size and moderate complexity. Although it declares 10 methods (nom = 10), there is no evidence of high coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) or many external dependencies (only 3 listed). Inheritance depth is 0 (dit = 0) and no metrics indicate excessive cohesion problems within the provided data. Given these values taken in isolation, there is insufficient evidence that the class has not been decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
