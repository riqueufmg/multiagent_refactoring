    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=12, WMC=1, NOM=1 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low complexity and high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has only 4 fields. These metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, monolithic class, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
