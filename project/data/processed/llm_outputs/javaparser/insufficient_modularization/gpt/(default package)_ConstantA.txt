    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: loc=3, nof=1 (one field), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no complexity). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency '(default package).B'). LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion issues in isolation. These metrics show no evidence of insufficient modularization."
