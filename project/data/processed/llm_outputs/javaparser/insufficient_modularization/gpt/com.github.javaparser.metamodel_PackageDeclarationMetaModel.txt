    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PackageDeclarationMetaModel",

    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple, cohesive class: LOC=10, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=2, LCOM=0.0. Low complexity (WMC=1), very small size (LOC=10), single method and few fields, zero fan-in/fan-out and a single dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) indicate no evidence that the class needs further decomposition. DIT=2 is benign here. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
