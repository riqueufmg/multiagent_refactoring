    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is extremely small and simple, so insufficient modularization is not indicated. Key metrics: LOC=3, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1, NOPF=1, DIT=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods to decompose (NOM=0), very low complexity (WMC=0), and no coupling or inheritance depth to suggest missed modular boundaries, so further decomposition is unnecessary."
