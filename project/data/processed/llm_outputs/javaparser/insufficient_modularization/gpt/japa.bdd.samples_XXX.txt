    "class": "japa.bdd.samples.XXX",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is not flagged for Insufficient Modularization because its metrics indicate minimal size and complexity: loc=2, nom=0, nof=0, nopf=0, nopm=0, wmc=0. Coupling is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0) and coherence is not meaningful (lcom=-1.0). With no methods or fields and negligible lines of code, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
