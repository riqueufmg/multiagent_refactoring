    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=6, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, single dependency (com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression). With only one method, no fields, minimal coupling and low complexity, there is no evidence it has not been decomposed; further decomposition would not meaningfully reduce size or complexity."
