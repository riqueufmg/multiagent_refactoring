    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.SymbolResolver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=18, NOM=4, WMC=4 and LCOM=-1.0 indicate low size, low implementation complexity and high cohesion. There are no fields (NOF=0) and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics the class does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would justify further decomposition when considered in isolation."
