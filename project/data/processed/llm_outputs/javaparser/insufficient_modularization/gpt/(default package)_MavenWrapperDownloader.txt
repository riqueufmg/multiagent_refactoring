    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=84 with only nom=3 methods but WMC=8 (concentrated complexity in few methods), nof=5 fields, LCOM=1.0 (very low cohesion) and only nopm=1 public method. The combination of relatively large size, concentrated complexity and low cohesion indicates the class likely bundles multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes/methods."
