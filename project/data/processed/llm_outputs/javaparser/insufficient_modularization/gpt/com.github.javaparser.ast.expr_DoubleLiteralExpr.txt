    "justification": "Not detected. The class is small (LOC=57) with a moderate number of simple methods (NOM=14, WMC=14 => average complexity ~1 per method). LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion rather than scattered responsibilities. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 and the listed dependencies (visitor interfaces, TokenRange, Range, metamodel) are typical for a single AST node and do not indicate a large, mixed responsibility class. Although DIT=6 shows deep inheritance, there is no evidence in the provided metrics of excessive size or internal complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
