    "justification": "Class is very small and contains no decomposable implementation: LOC=5, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0. It has no fields or methods (NOF=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0) and no external interactions (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate low cohesion in this context (no members to decompose). DIT=3 alone does not imply poor modularization. Given the minimal size and complexity, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
