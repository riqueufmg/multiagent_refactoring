    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.chunks.ModifierValidator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows multiple signals of insufficient modularization: high complexity (WMC = 44) and size (LOC = 168) with many methods (NOM = 18, NOPM = 12), indicating many behaviors concentrated in one class. Cohesion is relatively low (LCOM = 0.666...), suggesting the methods are not tightly related. The class depends on a wide variety of AST node types and concerns (EnumDeclaration, AnnotationDeclaration, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, MethodDeclaration, ConstructorDeclaration, FieldDeclaration, LambdaExpr, VariableDeclarationExpr, CatchClause, ModuleRequiresDirective, etc.), implying it handles multiple distinct modifier-validation responsibilities. Given these metrics and the broad set of dependencies, the class is a good candidate for decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
