    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: high implementation complexity (WMC = 47) and large size (LOC = 178) while exposing many operations (NOM = 9, NOPM = 7). The class also depends on numerous types (dependencies list contains ~10 entries), suggesting multiple responsibilities. Although cohesion appears acceptable (LCOM = -1.0), the combination of high complexity and size implies the class can likely be decomposed into smaller, more focused modules to reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
