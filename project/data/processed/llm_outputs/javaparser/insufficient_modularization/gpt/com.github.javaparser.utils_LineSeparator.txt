    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.LineSeparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC is moderate (114), number of methods is small-to-moderate (NOM=12, NOPM=10) and fields are few (NOF=2, NOPF=0). Cyclomatic/implementation complexity is moderate (WMC=22) but cohesion is high (LCOM=0.1667), which suggests a single, focused responsibility rather than multiple unrelated ones. Additionally the class is isolated (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, DIT=0), reducing evidence that it mixes distinct responsibilities that should be split. These elements collectively argue against flagging Insufficient Modularization."
