    "justification": "WMC = 20 with NOM = 5 (average complexity ≈ 4.0) and LOC = 78 indicates complexity concentrated in a small number of methods (likely large/complex methods). The class has DIT = 0 and fanin/fanout = 0 (utility/stateless shape) but depends on several external types (com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, NodeWithMembers, SymbolReference, NodeWithAnnotations, Node, JavaParserFactory), suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. These factors (high WMC relative to few methods, moderate LOC, and multiple external dependencies) support that the class is insufficiently modular and could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
