    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=14, WMC=1, NOM=1. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Although it has 6 fields (NOF=6, NOPF=6), there is a single method and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one dependency. These metrics indicate a small, cohesive data-holder rather than a class that needs further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
