    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithModifiers",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and moderately simple: LOC=66 and NOM=8 indicate a limited size and surface area, WMC=17 shows only moderate implementation complexity, and FANIN=0 / FANOUT=0 imply no broad coupling to or from other code in the provided data. LCOM=-1.0 gives no evidence of low cohesion in the available metrics. Dependencies are limited (NodeList, AccessSpecifier, Modifier). Given these metrics taken in isolation, there is no clear indication that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed or that further modularization is required."
