    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=12, WMC=1, NOM=1. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single external dependency). Number of fields (NOF=4) is modest and does not coincide with high method count or complexity. These metrics do not indicate a lack of decomposition or excessive size/complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
