    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=12, WMC=2, NOM=2, NOF=1 and NOPM=0. It has minimal dependencies (1) and no coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics show low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further or would benefit from additional modularization."
