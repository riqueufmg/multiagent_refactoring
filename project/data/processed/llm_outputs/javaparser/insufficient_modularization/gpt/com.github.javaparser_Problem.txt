    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=68, NOM=6 (NOPM=6), NOF=4, WMC=9. Low complexity and size reduce need for further decomposition. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and DIT=0, suggesting no deep hierarchy or broad responsibilities. Only two external dependencies (TokenRange, LineSeparator). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence of an under-modularized (overlarge or overly complex) class that requires decomposition."
