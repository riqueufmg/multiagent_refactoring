    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.MethodCallExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 220), high implementation complexity (wmc = 61), many methods (nom = 33) with most exposed (nopm = 30), and only moderate cohesion (lcom = 0.333). The depth in the hierarchy (dit = 4) combined with use of many external types (multiple dependencies) suggests the class is handling multiple responsibilities. These metrics together justify that further decomposition could reduce size and complexity."
