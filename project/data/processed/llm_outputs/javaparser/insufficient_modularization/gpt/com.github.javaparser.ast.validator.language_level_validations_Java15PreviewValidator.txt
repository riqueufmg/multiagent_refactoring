    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java15PreviewValidator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=15, NOM=1, WMC=1 indicate minimal size and low complexity; FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 indicate low coupling; NOPM=1 (one public method) supports a single responsibility. Although DIT=19 is high, in isolation it does not imply the class is large or needs decomposition. Therefore there is no evidence here that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed."
