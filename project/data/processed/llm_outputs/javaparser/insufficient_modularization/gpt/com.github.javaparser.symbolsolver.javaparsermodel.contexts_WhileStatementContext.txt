    "justification": "Class has only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3), small size (loc=32) and modest complexity (wmc=5). Cohesion appears high (lcom=-1.0) and there is no coupling pressure (fanin=0, fanout=0). No large method count, high complexity, or low cohesion indicators are present that would justify further decomposition in isolation."
