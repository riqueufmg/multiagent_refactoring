    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistTypeDeclarationAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits size and complexity indicative of insufficient modularization: LOC = 188 and WMC = 34 (high complexity), with 16 methods (nom = 16) of which 13 are public (nopm = 13) creating a large public surface. These metrics suggest the class holds multiple behaviors and a substantial implementation that could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity. Although LCOM = 0.0 indicates strong cohesion, the combination of high LOC, high WMC and many public methods justifies considering further decomposition (e.g., extracting helper/delegation classes or splitting distinct responsibilities)."
