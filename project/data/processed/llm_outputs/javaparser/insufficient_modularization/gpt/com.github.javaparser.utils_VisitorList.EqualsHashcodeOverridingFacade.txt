    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No smell: the class is small and simple (LOC=21), has no methods (nom=0) and minimal complexity (WMC=0), only one field (nof=1), shallow inheritance (DIT=1), very low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no external dependencies. Given the absence of methods/complex behavior to decompose, there is no evidence that further modularization would reduce size or implementation complexity."
