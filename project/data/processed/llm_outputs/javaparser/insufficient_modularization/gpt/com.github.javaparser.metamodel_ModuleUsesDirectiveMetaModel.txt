    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=9, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=1, LCOM=0.0. Low coupling and usage: fanin=0, fanout=0. Depth of inheritance (DIT=3) does not indicate internal complexity. Given the very low size and complexity metrics, there is no evidence this class needs further decomposition."
