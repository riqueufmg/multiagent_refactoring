    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=21, NOM=4, WMC=6. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). Given the low size, low complexity and strong cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
