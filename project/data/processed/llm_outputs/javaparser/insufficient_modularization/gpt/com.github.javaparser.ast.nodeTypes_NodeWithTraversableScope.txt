    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithTraversableScope",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is very small and simple: LOC=9, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0, NOPF=0, NC=2, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0, and there are no dependencies. In isolation these values show a single small method, no fields to split, low complexity and low coupling, so there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
