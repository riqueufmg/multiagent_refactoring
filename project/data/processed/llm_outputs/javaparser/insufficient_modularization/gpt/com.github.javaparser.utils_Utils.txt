    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: 26 methods (nom=26, nopm=25) concentrated in 230 LOC with high overall complexity (wmc=53). nof=0 indicates a stateless utility bag likely grouping many unrelated operations. The dependency set (Provider, LineSeparator, Node, UnaryExpr) shows the class touches multiple distinct concerns. These factors (many methods, high WMC, large LOC, multiple unrelated dependencies) justify decomposing the class into smaller, more focused modules."
