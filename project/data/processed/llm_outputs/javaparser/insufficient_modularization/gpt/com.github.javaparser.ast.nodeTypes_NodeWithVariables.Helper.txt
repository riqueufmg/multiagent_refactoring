    "justification": "Not detected: the class is very small and contains no internal complexity or responsibilities that suggest further decomposition. Metrics: LOC=14, NOF=0 (no fields), NOM=0 (no methods), WMC=0 (no complexity), FanIn=0, FanOut=0, Dependencies=[]. LCOM=-1.0 indicates no measurable cohesion issues given the absence of members. An isolated review of these elements does not support Insufficient Modularization."
