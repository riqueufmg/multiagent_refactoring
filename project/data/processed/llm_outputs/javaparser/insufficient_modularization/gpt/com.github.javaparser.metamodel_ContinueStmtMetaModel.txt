    "justification": "Class is small and well-scoped: LOC=9, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=1 indicating minimal size and complexity. High cohesion (LCOM=0.0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on PropertyMetaModel) show a single clear responsibility. DIT=3 alone does not imply the need for further decomposition. These metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
