    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and non-complex: LOC=9, WMC=0, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=3 (only three fields). Coupling is absent (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, dependencies=[]). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems in this context. Because there are no methods or significant implementation complexity to split and the class is minimal when considered in isolation, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
