    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected. The class is small and not complex: LOC=12, WMC=3, NOM=3, NC=3. LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. Although DIT=3 shows inheritance depth, the low size and low complexity metrics provide no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed."
