    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.InstanceOfExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a high number of methods (nom = 22) and high cyclomatic/structural complexity (wmc = 38) while its size is moderate (loc = 143). Cohesion is only moderate (lcom = 0.4545) and there are few fields (nof = 3), which indicates many behaviors operating on a small data set. The dependency list mixes multiple responsibilities (pattern support: com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.PatternExpr; type handling: com.github.javaparser.ast.type.Type and ReferenceType; visitor mechanics: GenericVisitor and VoidVisitor; metamodel/observer concerns: InstanceOfExprMetaModel, JavaParserMetaModel, ObservableProperty), suggesting the class combines AST node structure, pattern/type logic, visitor entry points, and metamodel/observer logic. Taken together (high method count and complexity, moderate cohesion, diverse dependencies), this indicates the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
