    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionClassAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modular: 14 methods (nom=14) and 13 public methods (nopm=13) concentrated in 149 LOC with a relatively high cyclomatic/weighted method count (wmc=41) — indicating substantial implementation complexity and multiple behaviors. It has few fields (nof=3) but many methods, suggesting behavior-heavy design that could be split. Dependencies to multiple distinct responsibilities (ReflectionFieldDeclaration, ReferenceTypeImpl, ResolvedType, TypeSolver, ReflectionFactory) imply it handles both reflection adaptation and type-resolution concerns, which are candidates for decomposition. Despite low lack-of-cohesion (lcom=0.0), the method count, high complexity, LOC and cross-cutting dependencies justify refactoring into smaller, focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
