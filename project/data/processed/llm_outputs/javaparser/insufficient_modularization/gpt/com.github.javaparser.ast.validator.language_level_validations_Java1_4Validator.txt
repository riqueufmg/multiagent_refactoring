    "justification": "The class is very small and not a candidate for further decomposition: nom=1 and nopm=1 (single method), loc=10 (very low size), wmc=1 (minimal complexity). Coupling is minimal (fanout=0, fanin=0) and cohesion appears high (lcom=-1.0). Although dit=7 indicates inheritance depth, there is no internal size or complexity to justify additional modularization."
