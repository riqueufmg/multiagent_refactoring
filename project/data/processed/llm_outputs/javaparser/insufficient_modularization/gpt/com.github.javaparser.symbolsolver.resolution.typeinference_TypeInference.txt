    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it is large and complex (LOC=277, WMC=69) with a relatively high method count (nom=21). Its dependency list spans multiple conceptual areas (BoundSet, ConstraintFormulaSet, InferenceVariable, InstantiationSet, TypeInferenceCache, ExpressionCompatibleWithType, ThrowsBound, SubtypeOfBound, etc.), indicating it handles bound/constraint management, variable/instantiation handling and caching all together. Although LCOM is low (0.1429) suggesting internal cohesion, the absolute size and high cyclomatic complexity imply the implementation could be split into smaller, focused classes (e.g., constraint solving, inference-variable management, caching/lookup) to reduce size and complexity."
