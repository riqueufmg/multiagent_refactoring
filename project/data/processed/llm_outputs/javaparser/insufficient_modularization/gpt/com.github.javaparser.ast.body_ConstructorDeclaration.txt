    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.ConstructorDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: a high number of methods (nom = 25) with many public methods (nopm = 25) while having a modest size (loc = 139) indicates many responsibilities packed into a small file. Its weighted methods complexity is relatively high (wmc = 34), and lack of cohesion is non-trivial (lcom = 0.8), suggesting methods are not tightly related. The depth of inheritance (dit = 5) and the number of external dependencies referenced also point to multiple concerns. Together these metrics justify that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
