    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.EqualsVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very large number of methods (nom=112, nopm=104) indicating many responsibilities; large size (loc=848) and very high complexity (wmc=481) concentrated in a single class; moderate/low cohesion (lcom=0.723) suggesting methods are not tightly related; dependency list spans a broad range of many distinct AST node types, implying the class handles many different concerns; shallow inheritance (dit=1) means this complexity is concentrated in this class rather than distributed. These elements together justify that the class should be further decomposed."
