    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=11, WMC=1, NOM=1. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency). Only 3 fields (NOF=3) and no excessive public members (NOPF=3 reflects model fields). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
