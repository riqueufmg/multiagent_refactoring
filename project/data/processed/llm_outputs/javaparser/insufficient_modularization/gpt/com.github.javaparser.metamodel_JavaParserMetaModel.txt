    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.JavaParserMetaModel",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is a strong candidate for Insufficient Modularization: it is very large (loc=973) and contains a huge number of fields (nof=119) of which almost all are public (nopf=118), while offering very little behavior (nom=6, nopm=2). It references a very large set of other MetaModel types (~119 dependencies), indicating it aggregates many responsibilities. Cohesion is relatively low (lcom=0.3333333333333333), suggesting the members do not form a tightly focused unit. Together these facts (very high field count and size, low method count, many external references, and low cohesion) indicate the class has not been decomposed sufficiently and would benefit from splitting into smaller, more focused modules."
