    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=35, NOM=9, WMC=9 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low implementation complexity and high cohesion. No fields of problematic size (NOF=2, NOPF=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed."
