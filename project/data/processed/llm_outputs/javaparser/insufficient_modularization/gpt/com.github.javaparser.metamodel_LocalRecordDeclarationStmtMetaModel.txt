    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.LocalRecordDeclarationStmtMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=9, nom=1, nof=1, nopf=1, wmc=1. Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel). Although DIT=3 indicates it participates in an inheritance chain, the very low size and complexity metrics do not indicate an incompletely decomposed class that would benefit from further modularization."
