    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 18 methods (nom=18, nopm=18) but only 1 field (nof=1), suggesting many behaviors not centered on a small object state. Its size and complexity are non-trivial (loc=93, wmc=26) and cohesion is moderate/low (lcom=0.611), which indicates the methods are not highly related. Depth of inheritance (dit=4) adds conceptual complexity. The class also depends on many external types (11 dependencies) implying multiple responsibilities or interactions. Taken together (high method count vs fields, moderate LOC/WMC, lowered cohesion, and many dependencies), these factors point to Insufficient Modularization and that further decomposition could reduce size and complexity."
