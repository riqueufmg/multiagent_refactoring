    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.TreeVisitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=55), modest complexity (wmc=9), small number of methods (nom=6, nopm=6), no fields (nof=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and high cohesion indicator (lcom=-1.0). These values suggest the class is already compact and cohesive and does not require further decomposition."
