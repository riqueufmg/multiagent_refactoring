    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.Printer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected. The class is very small and simple: LOC=6, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on com.github.javaparser.ast.Node). Cohesion indicator is favorable (LCOM=-1.0). These metrics show low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
