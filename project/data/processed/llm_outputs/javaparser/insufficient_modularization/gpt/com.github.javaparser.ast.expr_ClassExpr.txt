    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: a high number of methods (nom = 14) concentrated in a relatively small file (loc = 69) with a moderate-to-high complexity (wmc = 18). Cohesion is low (lcom = 0.714), indicating methods do not strongly operate on the same data, while there is only one field (nof = 1), which reinforces that the methods are likely implementing multiple responsibilities rather than collaborating around shared state. These metrics together suggest the class could be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive classes or components."
