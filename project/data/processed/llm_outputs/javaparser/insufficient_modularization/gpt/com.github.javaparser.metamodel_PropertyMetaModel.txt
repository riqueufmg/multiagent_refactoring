    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: high method count (nom=26) with all methods non-private (nopm=26) resulting in a large public API surface, large size (loc=194), and elevated complexity (wmc=36). These indicate a concentrated amount of behavior and implementation complexity that could be reduced by decomposing responsibilities into smaller classes or components.
