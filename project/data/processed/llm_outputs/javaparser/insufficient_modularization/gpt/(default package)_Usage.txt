    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=5, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0. It has no fields and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics show low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
