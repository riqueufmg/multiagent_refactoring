    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=12, number of methods (nom)=2, WMC=2 (low complexity). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. DIT=2 is modest. There is no evidence of large size, high complexity, or low cohesion that would justify further decomposition."
