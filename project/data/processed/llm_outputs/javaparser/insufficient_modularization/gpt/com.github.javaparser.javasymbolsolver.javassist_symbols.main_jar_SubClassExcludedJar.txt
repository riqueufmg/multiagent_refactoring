    "justification": "Class is very small and contains no behavior to decompose: LOC=3, NOM (number of methods)=0, WMC=0. It has only one field (NOF=1) and no public methods (NOPF=1, NOPM=0), no inheritance depth (DIT=0), no coupling (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0) and no external dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and cannot be meaningfully further decomposed, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
