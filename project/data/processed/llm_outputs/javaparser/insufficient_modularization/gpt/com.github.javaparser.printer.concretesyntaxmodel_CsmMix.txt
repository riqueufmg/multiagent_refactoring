    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=33, NOM=6, WMC=10 (moderate complexity but not large), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). It has a single field (NOF=1) and no public fields (NOPF=0). Coupling indicators are low (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the small size, low coupling, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
