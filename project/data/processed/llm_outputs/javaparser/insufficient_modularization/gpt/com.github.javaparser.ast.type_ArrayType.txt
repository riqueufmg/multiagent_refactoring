    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.ArrayType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is a candidate for further decomposition: 26 methods (nom=26) with 25 public (nopm=25) exposing a large API surface, 196 lines of code (loc=196) and high cyclomatic complexity (wmc=38). The class contains inner types (ArrayType.ArrayBracketPair, ArrayType.Origin) suggesting multiple responsibilities implemented in one unit. Cohesion is only moderate (lcom=0.423) and the inheritance depth is relatively deep (dit=5), which can compound complexity. The dependency list shows the class interacts with many concerns (visitor support, resolution types, annotations, token/range handling, node lists, meta-model, observers), implying mixed responsibilities. Together these factors (high method count and public API, large LOC, high WMC, inner classes, moderate cohesion, and diverse dependencies) justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
