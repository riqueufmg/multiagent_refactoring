    "class": "com.github.javaparser.CharStream",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: Although the class has 14 methods (nom=14) and a moderate cyclomatic weight (wmc=14), the overall size is small (loc=66). There are no fields (nof=0), indicating a stateless/utility-like class where methods can legitimately be grouped together. Cohesion measure is not indicating clear fragmentation (lcom=-1.0), and there are no external coupling signals (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the small LOC and lack of fields or coupling, there is insufficient evidence that the class is inadequately decomposed."
