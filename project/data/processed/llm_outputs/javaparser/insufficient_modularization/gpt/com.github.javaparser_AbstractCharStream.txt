    "class": "com.github.javaparser.AbstractCharStream",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being too large/complex for a single unit: LOC = 344 and WMC = 79 indicate substantial implementation size and complexity; NOM = 28 methods and NOF = 16 fields (with NOPM = 17 public methods) suggest many responsibilities and surface area that could be split. DIT = 1 and NC = 1 show the complexity is concentrated in this class rather than distributed in a hierarchy. Although LCOM = 0.071 indicates good cohesion, the absolute size (LOC, WMC) and high count of methods/fields justify further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
