    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.postprocessors.Java14PostProcessor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is minimal and contains no behavior or state: loc=5, nof=0 (no fields), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no complexity), fanin=0, fanout=0. LCOM=-1 indicates no meaningful cohesion metrics due to absence of members. Although DIT=5 shows a deep inheritance level, in isolation the class has no code to decompose, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
