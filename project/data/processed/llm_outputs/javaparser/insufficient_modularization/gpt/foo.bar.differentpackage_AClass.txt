    "class": "foo.bar.differentpackage.AClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is very small and not complex: loc=4, nom=0, wmc=0. It has only 2 fields (nof=2) and no methods to decompose, low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a cohesive metric (lcom=-1.0). These metrics indicate there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
