    "justification": "The class does not exhibit strong evidence of Insufficient Modularization when considered in isolation. Key metrics: LOC=47 (small size), NOM=10 and WMC=11 (moderate complexity but not large), NOF=1 and NOPF=0 (very few fields), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (low coupling), DIT=5 (deep inheritance but not indicative by itself). LCOM=0.7 indicates some cohesion concerns, but given the small LOC and moderate method/complexity counts, the class size and complexity do not justify further decomposition on their own. Dependencies present (TokenRange, metamodel and observer types) do not increase class size or complexity enough to change this assessment."
