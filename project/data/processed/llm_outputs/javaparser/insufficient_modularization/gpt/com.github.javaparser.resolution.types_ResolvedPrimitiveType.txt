    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedPrimitiveType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modular: it declares 21 methods (nopm=20 public) indicating a large public surface, WMC=39 indicating high implementation complexity, and LOC=128 showing substantial size. Cohesion is moderate/low (LCOM=0.5238) which suggests methods are not tightly related. Only 3 fields (nof=3) while providing many methods implies the class groups multiple behaviors rather than cohesive stateful responsibilities. These metrics together justify recommending further decomposition."
