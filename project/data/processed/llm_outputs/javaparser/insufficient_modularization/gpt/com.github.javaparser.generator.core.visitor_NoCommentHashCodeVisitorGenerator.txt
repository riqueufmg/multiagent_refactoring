    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC = 48, number of methods (nom) = 2 (public methods nopm = 1), no fields (nof = 0). Cohesion is high (LCOM = -1.0). Although WMC = 10 shows some internal complexity, the overall size and method count are low and there is no recorded coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). These metrics indicate the class does not require further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
