    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.EnclosedExprContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=5, number of methods (nom)=1, weighted method complexity (wmc)=1, number of fields (nof)=0. It shows no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and has only a single public method (nopm=1). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition; there is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would justify Insufficient Modularization. (DIT=3 is the only larger metric but does not imply the class itself is insufficiently modular.)"
