    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: 24 methods (nom=24) with all methods public (nopm=24) and a relatively large size (loc=154) combined with high complexity (wmc=38) indicate many responsibilities and behavioral complexity in a single class. Cohesion is moderate (lcom=0.4166666666666667) rather than high, suggesting methods are not tightly focused on a single responsibility. Depth of inheritance (dit=4) increases implicit responsibilities. These metrics together (high method count, high WMC, moderate cohesion, sizable LOC) justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
