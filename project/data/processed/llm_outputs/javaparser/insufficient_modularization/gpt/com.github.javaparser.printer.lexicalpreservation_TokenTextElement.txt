    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.TokenTextElement",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom = 24) with many public methods (nopm = 18) while its source size is small (loc = 78), indicating many responsibilities crammed into a compact file. Its weighted method count (wmc = 26) is high relative to LOC, showing concentrated complexity. There is only one field (nof = 1), which suggests much of the behavior is implemented as numerous independent operations rather than encapsulated stateful components and therefore could be moved into separate classes. The class depends on multiple distinct concepts (LexicalPreservingVisitor, Node, JavaToken), implying it handles different concerns (visitor/token/node handling) that are candidates for decomposition. LCOM = 0.25 shows only moderate cohesion given the method count, reinforcing the likelihood that further modularization would reduce size and implementation complexity."
