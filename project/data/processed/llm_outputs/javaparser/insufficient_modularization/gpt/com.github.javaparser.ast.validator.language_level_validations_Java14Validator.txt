    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java14Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=19), very low complexity (wmc=1), only one method (nom=1/nopm=1), high cohesion (lcom=0.0), and no coupling to other classes (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although the inheritance depth is high (dit=17), in isolation the class is simple and focused, so further decomposition is not indicated."
