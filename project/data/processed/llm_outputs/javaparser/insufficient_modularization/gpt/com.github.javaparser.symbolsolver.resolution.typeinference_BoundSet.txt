    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.BoundSet",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High size and complexity: LOC=530 and WMC=134 indicate a large, complex class; 32 methods (nom=32) with 12 public methods (nopm=12) imply many internal behaviors. Presence of nested/auxiliary types BoundSet.Processor and BoundSet.VariableDependency suggests the class already contains multiple distinct responsibilities. The class depends on many distinct concepts (Bound, Substitution, Instantiation/InstantiationSet, ConstraintFormulaSet, TypeHelper, various bound and constraint formula classes, InferenceVariable, etc.), showing it handles diverse concerns (bound management, processing, substitution, instantiation, constraint solving). Although LCOM is low (0.0625), meaning elements are related, the absolute size and complexity plus multiple embedded roles support that further decomposition (e.g., separate processor, dependency handling, substitution/instantiation and constraint management components) would reduce size and implementation complexity. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is detected."
