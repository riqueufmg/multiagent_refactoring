    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: loc = 50 (small size), nom = 11 (moderate number of methods), wmc = 11 (overall complexity modest — roughly 1 per method on average), lcom = -1.0 (indicates high cohesion), nof = 0 and nopf = 0 (no/zero public fields), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (low coupling). dit = 0 shows no deep inheritance. Dependencies are limited and focused (Javadoc, Node, JavadocComment, Comment), consistent with a single cohesive responsibility. These factors argue against further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
