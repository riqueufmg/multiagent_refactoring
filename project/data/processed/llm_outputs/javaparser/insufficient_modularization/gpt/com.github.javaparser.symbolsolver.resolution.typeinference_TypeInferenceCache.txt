    "justification": "The class is small and focused: LOC=43, NOM=4 (only four methods) and NOF=2 fields. Although WMC=12 indicates some per-method complexity, that complexity is not accompanied by a large size or many responsibilities. Cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.5) and there is no coupling to or from other classes in the provided data (fanin=0, fanout=0). Taken in isolation these metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class that would benefit from further decomposition."
