    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=17, nom=3, wmc=3. LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. No incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the low size and complexity metrics and absence of coupling, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
