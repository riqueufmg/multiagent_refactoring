    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=7, NOM=2, WMC=2. Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0) and coupling is minimal (Fan-out=0, single dependency 'foo.Foo'). There is no indication of excessive size, complexity, or low cohesion that would warrant further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
