    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.DefaultVisitorAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: very high method count (nom = 103) and matching high complexity (wmc = 103), sizable implementation (loc = 311); it depends on a very large and diverse set of AST node types (the provided dependency list contains many distinct AST node classes), indicating multiple responsibilities handled in one class. Additionally the class has minimal inheritance depth (dit = 1) and few subclasses (nc = 2), suggesting functionality is concentrated rather than delegated. These elements together justify that the class should be further decomposed."
