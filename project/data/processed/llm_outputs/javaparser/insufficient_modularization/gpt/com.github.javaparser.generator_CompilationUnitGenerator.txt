    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.CompilationUnitGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=12, NOM=3, WMC=4. No fields (NOF=0), low inheritance depth (DIT=1) and high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external dependencies are listed. These metrics show no evidence that the class is overly large or complex and therefore do not indicate Insufficient Modularization."
