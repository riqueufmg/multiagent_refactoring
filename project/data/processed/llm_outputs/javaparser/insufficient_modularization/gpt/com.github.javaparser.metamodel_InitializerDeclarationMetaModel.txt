    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=10, NOM=1, WMC=1. It has only 2 fields (NOF=2) and shows high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). Low coupling is indicated by FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0. These metrics do not suggest an incompletely decomposed or overly large class that would require further modularization; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
