    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.InferenceVariableSubstitution",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: 3 fields (nof=3), 3 methods (nom=3) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), 23 LOC, and low complexity (WMC=3). It has no external coupling in the provided data (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although LCOM=0.6667 indicates only moderate cohesion, given the low size and complexity there is no strong evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed or requires further modularization."
