    "justification": "Class has small size and moderate complexity (LOC=69, WMC=10) and high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). It has a modest number of methods (nom=9, nopm=8) and fields (nof=6) but no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only an inner enum dependency. There is no metric evidence of excessive size, high complexity, low cohesion, or high coupling that would indicate it has not been decomposed and needs further modularization."
