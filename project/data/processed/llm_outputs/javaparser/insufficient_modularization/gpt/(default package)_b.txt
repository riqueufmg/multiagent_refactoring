    "justification": "Class has extremely small size and complexity: LOC=2, no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), WMC=0, no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no dependencies. Given its minimal footprint and lack of implementation, there is no evidence that it needs further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
