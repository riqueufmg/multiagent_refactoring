    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.modules.ModuleDirective",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it defines a large number of methods (nom=44) with high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=44) concentrated in a single class. It has moderate size (loc=131) but 44 methods (nopm=44) — suggesting many public responsibilities — while having no fields (nof=0), which indicates procedural behavior rather than well-encapsulated state. The cohesion metric is not favorable (lcom=-1.0), and the class depends on multiple specific directive types (ModuleProvidesDirective, ModuleRequiresDirective, ModuleUsesDirective, ModuleOpensDirective, ModuleExportsDirective) implying it handles multiple responsibilities that could be split. The inheritance depth (dit=3) further increases its combined responsibilities. Together these factors justify refactoring/decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
