    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionRecordDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very high method count (nom = 39) with almost all methods public (nopm = 37) which indicates a large API surface and multiple responsibilities; high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc = 72); relatively large size (loc = 257); deep inheritance (dit = 5) increasing behavioral complexity; and many external interactions (dependency list includes numerous distinct types). Although LCOM = 0.2308 suggests some cohesion, the combination of high method count, high WMC, large LOC and extensive dependencies justifies that the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
