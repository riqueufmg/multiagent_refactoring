    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.postprocessors.Java23PostProcessor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: very small size (loc=5), no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), single compilation unit (nc=1), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate minimal implementation and no internal complexity to decompose. Although DIT=14 is high, in isolation the class's negligible size and lack of behavior do not justify further decomposition."
