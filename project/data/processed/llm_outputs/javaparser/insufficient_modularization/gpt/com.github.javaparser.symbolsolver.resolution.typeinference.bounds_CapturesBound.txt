    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.bounds.CapturesBound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=39), modest method count (nom=8, nopm=8), moderate complexity (wmc=11) and low inheritance depth (dit=1). Cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.375). Low coupling/few dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0, single listed dependency). These values suggest the class is small, reasonably cohesive, and not overly complex, so further decomposition is not justified based on the provided data."
