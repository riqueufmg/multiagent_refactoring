    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.UnaryExpr.Operator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC 16, 2 fields (nof 2), zero methods (nom 0), low complexity (WMC 0), no coupling (fanin 0, fanout 0), shallow inheritance (DIT 1) and LCOM -1.0 (no indication of cohesion problems). These metrics indicate the class does not require further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
