    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithBlockStmt",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and cohesive (LOC=12, NOM=3), has low complexity (WMC=3), no fields (NOF=0), and no external coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Given these metrics there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or requires decomposition."
