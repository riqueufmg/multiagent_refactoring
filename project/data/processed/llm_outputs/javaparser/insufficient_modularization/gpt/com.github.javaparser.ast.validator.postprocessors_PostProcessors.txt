    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.postprocessors.PostProcessors",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=30), few methods (nom=6, nopm=6), low overall complexity (WMC=7), single field (nof=1), high cohesion (LCOM=0.0), no inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no coupling to other classes (fanin=0, fanout=0). These values suggest the class is small, cohesive and not overly complex, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
