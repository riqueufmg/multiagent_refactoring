    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC is small (36), number of fields is low (nof=2), there are no methods (nom=0) and no public methods (nopm=0), cyclomatic/implementation complexity is zero (wmc=0), coupling is nil (fanin=0, fanout=0). These values imply the class is small and simple rather than a large undecomposed unit."
