    "justification": "Class is minimal and contains no internal implementation to decompose: loc=2, nom=0, nof=0, wmc=0, nopm=0. Coupling and usage are absent (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). LCOM=-1.0 indicates no applicable cohesion data. Given the lack of methods, fields, complexity, or dependencies, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
