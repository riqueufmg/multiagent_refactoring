    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=27, WMC=5, NOM=5, NOF=2. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). There is no excessive coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dependencies are limited and focused. These metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large, or overly complex class that would require further modularization; hence Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
