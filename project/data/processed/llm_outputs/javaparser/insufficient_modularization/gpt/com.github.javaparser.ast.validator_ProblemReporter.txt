    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.ProblemReporter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show evidence of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=28), low complexity (wmc=4), only 4 methods (nom=4) and a single field (nof=1). There are no external interactions or inheritance pressure (fanin=0, fanout=0, nc=0). Although LCOM=0.75 indicates a potential cohesion concern, taken in isolation the class is small and simple enough that further decomposition is not clearly warranted based on the provided metrics."
