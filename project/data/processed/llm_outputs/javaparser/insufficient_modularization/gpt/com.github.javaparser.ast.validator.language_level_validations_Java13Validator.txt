    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java13Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=9, NOM=1, NOF=0, WMC=1. Coupling is minimal (fanout=0, fanin=0) and cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0). There are no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already fine-grained and does not exhibit insufficient modularization; the high DIT (16) alone, considered in isolation, does not justify further decomposition."
