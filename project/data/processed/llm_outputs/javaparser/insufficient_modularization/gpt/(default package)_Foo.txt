    "justification": "Class has very small size and no decomposable elements: LOC=3, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPF=0, WMC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0, and no dependencies. There are no methods, fields, or measurable complexity to further decompose, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
