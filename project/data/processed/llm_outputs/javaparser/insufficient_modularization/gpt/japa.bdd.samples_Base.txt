    "justification": "Class is not insufficiently modularized: very small size and complexity (loc=4, nom=1, nopm=1, wmc=1), no fields (nof=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), no inheritance/children (dit=0, nc=0), and cohesion metric does not indicate fragmentation (lcom=-1.0). These metrics show a minimal, cohesive class with no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
