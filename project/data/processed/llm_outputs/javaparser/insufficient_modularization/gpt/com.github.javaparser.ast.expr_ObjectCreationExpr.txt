    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.ObjectCreationExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high method count (nom = 28, nopm = 28) combined with substantial complexity (wmc = 62) and non-trivial size (loc = 238). Cohesion is moderate (lcom = 0.4285714285714285) rather than high, and depth of inheritance is relatively deep (dit = 4), increasing conceptual complexity. The class depends on a wide range of concerns (NodeList, ResolvedConstructorDeclaration, visitor interfaces, Range, TokenRange, Expression, Node, ClassOrInterfaceType, BodyDeclaration, Type, ObservableProperty, metamodel classes), suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. Together these metrics and dependency breadth indicate the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
