    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=15, number of methods=2, WMC=3 (low complexity). It has no fields (nof=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and LCOM=-1.0 (indicates cohesion). These metrics show the class is simple and well-contained, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
