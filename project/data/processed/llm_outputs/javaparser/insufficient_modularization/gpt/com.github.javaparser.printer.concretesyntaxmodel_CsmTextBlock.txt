    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=18, WMC=4, NOM=4. Low complexity and size indicate no need for further decomposition. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). These metrics do not support an Insufficient Modularization smell."
