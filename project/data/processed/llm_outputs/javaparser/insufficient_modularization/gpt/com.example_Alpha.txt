    "class": "com.example.Alpha",

    "justification": "Class has minimal size and complexity: LOC=4, NOF=0 (no fields), NOM=0 (no methods), WMC=0 (no complexity), DIT=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. LCOM=-1.0 indicates no cohesion concerns given no members. Given the lack of fields, methods, complexity, and dependencies, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modular or that it should be further decomposed."
