    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: loc=27, nom=7, wmc=7. It has no incoming/outgoing coupling according to fanin=0 and fanout=0 and only three external type dependencies [com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList, com.github.javaparser.ast.type.TypeParameter, com.github.javaparser.StaticJavaParser]. The cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) does not indicate poor cohesion. Given the small size, modest complexity and limited dependencies, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further—insufficient modularization is not detected."
