    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.MemberValuePairMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=10, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=2. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) apart from a single dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel) and a shallow inheritance depth (DIT=2). These metrics indicate the class is simple and cohesive and does not show signs of insufficient modularization (no need to further decompose)."
