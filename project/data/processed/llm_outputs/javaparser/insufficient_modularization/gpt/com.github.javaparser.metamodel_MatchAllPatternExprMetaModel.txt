        "Very small size: loc=9 and nom=1 indicate the class is minimal and not large enough to require decomposition.",
        "Low complexity: wmc=1 shows trivial method complexity, so no internal complexity that would benefit from modularization.",
        "High cohesion: lcom=0.0 indicates methods/fields are cohesive, not a sign of multiple responsibilities.",
        "Low coupling and isolation: fanin=0 and fanout=0 imply no external coupling that would suggest splitting for reuse or separation.",
        "Although DIT=4 is relatively deep, in isolation it does not indicate insufficient modularization given the class's minimal size and complexity."
