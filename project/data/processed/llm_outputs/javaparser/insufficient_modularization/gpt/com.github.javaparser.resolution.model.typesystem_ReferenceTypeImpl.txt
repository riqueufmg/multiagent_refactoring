    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.typesystem.ReferenceTypeImpl",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a relatively large size and complexity (loc=161, wmc=45) with many methods (nom=17, nopm=14). Cohesion is low (lcom=0.8235294117647058) while there is very little shared state (nof=1), which indicates its methods are not focused on a single responsibility. It also depends on multiple external types (8 dependencies). These metrics together suggest the class aggregates multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
