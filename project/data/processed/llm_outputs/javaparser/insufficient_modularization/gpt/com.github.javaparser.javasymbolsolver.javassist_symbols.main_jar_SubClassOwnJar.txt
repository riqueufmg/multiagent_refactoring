    "justification": "Class is minimal and cannot be further decomposed: LOC = 3, NOM = 0 (no methods), WMC = 0 (no complexity), NOF = 1 (single field), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (no coupling). DIT = 1 but with no behavior to split. Given the lack of methods and very small size, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
