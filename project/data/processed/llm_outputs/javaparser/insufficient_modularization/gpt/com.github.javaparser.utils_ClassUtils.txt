    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=49, 2 fields (nof=2) and 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2). Cyclomatic/implementation complexity is low (WMC=3). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies listed. These metrics indicate the class is already compact and cohesive, so there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
