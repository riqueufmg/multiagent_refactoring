    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=11, NOM=2, WMC=2. Low coupling and limited scope: fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]. Shallow inheritance: DIT=1. Cohesion not indicating fragmentation: LCOM=-1.0. These metrics show low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed enough."
