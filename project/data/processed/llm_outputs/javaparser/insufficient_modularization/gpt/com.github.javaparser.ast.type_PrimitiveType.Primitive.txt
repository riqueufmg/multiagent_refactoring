    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: loc=29, nof=3 fields, nom=0 methods, wmc=0 (low complexity), dit=1, lcom=-1.0 (indicates cohesion), fanin=0, fanout=0. These metrics show low size and complexity and reasonable cohesion, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
