    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected. The class is small (loc=70) with many short methods (nom=20 → avg ≈3.5 LOC/method) and WMC=20 roughly equal to nom, indicating low per-method complexity rather than a few large complex methods. Cohesion is good (lcom=0.25), there are only 3 fields (nof=3) and no measured coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). While DIT=4 shows inheritance depth, nothing in the provided metrics indicates a single class combining multiple unrelated responsibilities that would benefit from further decomposition."
