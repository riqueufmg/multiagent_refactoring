    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration.DefaultPrinterConfiguration.ConfigOption",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and contains minimal state and behavior: LOC=36, NOF=2 fields, NOM=0 methods, WMC=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency: com.github.javaparser.utils.LineSeparator). These metrics indicate low size, zero implementation complexity, and low coupling, so there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
