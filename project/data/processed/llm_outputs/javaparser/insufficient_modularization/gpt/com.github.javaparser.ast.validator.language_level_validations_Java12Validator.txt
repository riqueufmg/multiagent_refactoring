    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=9, NOM=1 (1 method), WMC=1, NOPM=1, NC=2, fanin=0, fanout=0, and no declared dependencies. These metrics indicate a single, simple responsibility and do not suggest it needs further decomposition. (DIT=15 is noted but, in isolation, does not by itself indicate insufficient modularization.)"
