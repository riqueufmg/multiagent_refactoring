    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: LOC = 54 and NOM = 7 show a small-sized class; NOF = 3 indicates few fields; WMC = 17 (average complexity ~2.4 per method) is only moderately elevated and does not by itself imply a need to split; LCOM = 0.2857 indicates good cohesion (methods share state/are related); DIT = 1 and NC = 0 show no deep inheritance concerns; fanin/fanout = 0 and only two external dependencies suggest limited coupling. Taken in isolation, these elements imply the class is reasonably cohesive and sized, so further decomposition is not clearly warranted."
