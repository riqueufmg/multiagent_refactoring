    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive, so further decomposition is not warranted. Evidence: LOC = 59 (small), NOM = 5 methods (few responsibilities), WMC = 15 (moderate overall complexity but not excessive for 5 methods), LCOM = 0.0 (high cohesion), number of fields = 3 and NOPF = 0 (no large field set), DIT = 1 (shallow inheritance), FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 (low coupling). Based on these metrics analyzed in isolation, the class does not exhibit the size or internal complexity typical of Insufficient Modularization."
