    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=11, WMC=1, NOM=1, LCOM=0.0. It has low coupling (fanout=0, fanin=0) and no public fields (nopf=0). Only 2 fields (NOF=2) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1). Metrics show no evidence of being large, complex, or having multiple responsibilities that would warrant further decomposition."
