    "justification": "Class has minimal size and no internal implementation to decompose: loc=5, nof=0, nom=0, nopf=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. These metrics indicate zero methods/fields and zero complexity/dependencies, so there is no evidence of a large or complex class that would benefit from further decomposition. (DIT=10 is a structural inheritance depth but does not by itself indicate insufficient modularization.)"
