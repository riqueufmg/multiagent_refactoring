    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionTypeParameter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show clear indicators of Insufficient Modularization: size is modest (LOC=72) with a moderate number of methods (nom=11), few fields (nof=3), and a cohesion value indicating good cohesion (LCOM=0.1818). Although WMC=21 is somewhat elevated, it is not supported by low cohesion or a very large size that would suggest multiple responsibilities. DIT=4 shows inheritance depth but does not by itself imply missing decomposition. Fanin and fanout are 0, showing no broad coupling that would suggest a monolithic utility class. Therefore, based on the provided metrics in isolation, there is no strong evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
