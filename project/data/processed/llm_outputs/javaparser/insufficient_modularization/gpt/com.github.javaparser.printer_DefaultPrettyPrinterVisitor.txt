    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.DefaultPrettyPrinterVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is excessively large and complex: 124 methods (nom = 124), 1688 lines of code (loc = 1688), high cyclomatic/complexity weight (wmc = 354) and 106 public methods (nopm = 106). It also depends on a very large number of AST node/types (many entries in the dependency list), indicating it handles many distinct responsibilities. These metrics strongly suggest the class can be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity. (Note: LCOM is low (0.024), which indicates internal cohesion, but the absolute size and complexity still justify further modularization.)"
