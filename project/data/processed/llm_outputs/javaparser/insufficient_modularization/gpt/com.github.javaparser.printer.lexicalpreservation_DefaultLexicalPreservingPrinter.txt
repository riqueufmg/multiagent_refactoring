    "justification": "The class is small and simple: nom=1 (one method), loc=11, wmc=1 (very low complexity), nof=0 and nopf=0 (no fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0, and lcom=-1.0 (indicating cohesion). Given its single method, minimal size and complexity, and lack of fields or strong coupling to many other components, there is no evidence it has not been decomposed further. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
