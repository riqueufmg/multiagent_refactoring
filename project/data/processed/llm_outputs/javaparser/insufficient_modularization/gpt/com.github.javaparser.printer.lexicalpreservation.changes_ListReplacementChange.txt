    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=35, NOM=3, WMC=6 indicate limited size and moderate complexity. LCOM=0.0 shows high cohesion. There are no nested classes (NC=0), and no incoming/outgoing coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the low method count and low complexity, there is no evidence the class needs further decomposition."
