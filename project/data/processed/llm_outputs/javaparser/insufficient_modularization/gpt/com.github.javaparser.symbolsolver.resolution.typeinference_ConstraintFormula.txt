    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has low implementation complexity and appears cohesive: nom=1 (one method), wmc=1 (very low complexity), lcom=0.0 (high cohesion). It only has 2 fields (nof=2) and limited dependencies (BoundSet and its inner ReductionResult). LOC=87 is modest but the single-method structure and low complexity indicate no need for further decomposition; therefore insufficient modularization is not detected."
