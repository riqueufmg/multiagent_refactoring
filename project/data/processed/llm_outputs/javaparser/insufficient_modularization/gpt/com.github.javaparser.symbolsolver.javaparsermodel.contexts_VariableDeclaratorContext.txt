    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.VariableDeclaratorContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=14), very few methods (nom=2, nopm=2), low complexity (wmc=3), no fields (nof=0), high cohesion (lcom=-1.0), and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, limited external dependencies). These metrics indicate the class is already small, focused, and low-complexity, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
