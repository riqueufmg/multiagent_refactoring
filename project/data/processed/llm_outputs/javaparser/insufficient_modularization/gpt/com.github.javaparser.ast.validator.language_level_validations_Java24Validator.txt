    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java24Validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=8, NOM=1, NOPM=1, WMC=1, NC=1, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. It contains a single method and no dependencies, indicating low internal size and complexity. These metrics provide no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized and that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity. (DIT=27 is high but, in isolation, does not imply internal decomposition is needed.)"
