    "class": "com.example.Beta",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is tiny and contains no behavior to decompose: loc=5, nom=0, wmc=0. It has only one field (nof=1), no public non-field members (nopf=0), and no method complexity or coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). DIT=1 indicates simple inheritance but does not imply internal complexity. Given the lack of methods, low LOC, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that the class suffers from Insufficient Modularization."
