    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive, so further decomposition is not warranted. Metrics show LOC=7, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=1 and LCOM=0.0, indicating low size, low complexity and high cohesion. Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 indicate minimal coupling. There are no signs (large LOC, high WMC, many methods or high LCOM) that would justify Insufficient Modularization."
