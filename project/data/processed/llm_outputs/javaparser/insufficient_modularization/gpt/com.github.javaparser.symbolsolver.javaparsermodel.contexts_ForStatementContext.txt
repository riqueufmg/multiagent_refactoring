    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: nom=6 methods, loc=65, and LCOM=-1.0 (indicating high cohesion). Complexity is moderate (WMC=16) but not excessive given the method count. Coupling appears low in terms of usage (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is modest (DIT=3). Although there are several listed dependencies, the internal size and cohesion metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, overly large class that requires further modularization."
