    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of Insufficient Modularization: 10 methods (nom=10) with 10 public methods (nopm=10) concentrated in a small 44-line file (loc=44) indicates multiple responsibilities packed into one type. Cyclomatic/implementation complexity is non-trivial (wmc=10) for the class size. Cohesion is low (lcom=0.7), suggesting methods do not work on a single, well-focused set of fields/behavior. There are 4 fields (nof=4) but no public fields (nopf=0), reinforcing that behavior (methods) rather than a simple data holder dominates the class. Given these metrics, further decomposition (splitting responsibilities into smaller classes/methods) is warranted."
