    "justification": "Class is too small to indicate Insufficient Modularization: LOC = 2, NOM = 0, WMC = 0, no fields or members (NOF/NOPF/NOPM = 0), FANIN = 0, FANOUT = 0. LCOM = -1.0 indicates cohesion metric not applicable here. The only dependency is an inner type (foo.A.FindMeIfYouCan). Given the minimal size and complexity, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
