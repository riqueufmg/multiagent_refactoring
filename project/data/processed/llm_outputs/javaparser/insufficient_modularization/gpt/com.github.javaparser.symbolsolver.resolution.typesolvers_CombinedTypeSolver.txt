    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class size (LOC=214) and method count (nom=15) show moderate size, other metrics do not indicate an incomplete decomposition: cohesion is high (LCOM=0.133), complexity is moderate (WMC=29) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). Field count (nof=9) is not excessive and there is no evidence of heavy coupling from or to the class (fanin=0, fanout=0). Taken in isolation, these factors do not provide sufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
