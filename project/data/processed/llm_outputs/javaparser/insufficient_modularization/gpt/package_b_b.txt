    "justification": "Class is extremely small and contains no decomposable elements: loc=2, nom=0 (no methods), nof=0 (no fields), nopf=0, nopm=0. Complexity and coupling are minimal (wmc=0, nc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 (not applicable). Given the absence of methods/fields and negligible size/complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
