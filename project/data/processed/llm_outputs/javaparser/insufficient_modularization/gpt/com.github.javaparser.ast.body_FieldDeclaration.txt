    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows indicators of insufficient modularization: high method count (nom = 31, nopm = 30) and large size (loc = 202) meaning many behaviors in one class; high cyclomatic/weighted complexity (wmc = 49) indicating implementation complexity that could be reduced by splitting responsibilities; low number of fields (nof = 2) combined with many methods suggests many independent operations not organized around internal state (potential multiple responsibilities); moderate cohesion (lcom ≈ 0.516) implies methods are not highly cohesive and could be grouped into smaller classes; many external dependencies (multiple distinct types in the dependency list) and a nontrivial inheritance depth (dit = 4) further indicate the class touches diverse concerns that are good candidates for decomposition. These factors, considered in isolation, justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
