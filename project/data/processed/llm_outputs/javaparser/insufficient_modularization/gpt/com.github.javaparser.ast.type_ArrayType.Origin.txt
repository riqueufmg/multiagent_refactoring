    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=10, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=0 (no fields), WMC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, and no dependencies. These metrics indicate very low size and complexity and no coupling that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
