    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC = 59, NOM = 5, NOF = 3 and LCOM = 0.0 indicate a compact, highly cohesive unit. Although WMC = 17 shows some method complexity, the overall size and low number of methods do not support a clear need for further decomposition. DIT = 1 and fan-in/fan-out = 0 also show limited coupling and shallow inheritance, so there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
