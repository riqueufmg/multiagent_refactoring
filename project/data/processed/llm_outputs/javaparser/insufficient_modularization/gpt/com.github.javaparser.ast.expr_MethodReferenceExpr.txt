    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (nom=22, all public nopm=22) while having few fields (nof=3), indicating many behaviors per state and likely multiple responsibilities. Its implementation complexity is elevated (wmc=36) and size is non-trivial (loc=137), which together suggest the class contains clustered logic that could be split. Cohesion is moderate-to-low (lcom=0.5454), supporting that related behaviors are not tightly cohesive. The class also depends on a variety of external types (multiple listed dependencies) and has a deep inheritance level (dit=4), both increasing the chance that decomposition would reduce complexity and improve modularity. These factors justify flagging Insufficient Modularization and recommend further decomposition."
