    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=8, NOM=1 (1 method), WMC=1 (very low complexity), NOF=0 (no fields), NOPM=1, FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling to or from other classes), and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and focused; there is no evidence of excessive size or internal complexity that would justify further decomposition. (DIT=6 is high but, considered in isolation, the class implementation remains trivial and does not indicate insufficient modularization.)"
