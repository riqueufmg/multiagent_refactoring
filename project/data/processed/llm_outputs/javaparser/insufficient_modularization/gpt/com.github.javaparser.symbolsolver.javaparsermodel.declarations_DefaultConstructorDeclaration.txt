    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: relatively many methods (nom=9, nopm=8) packed into a small file (loc=34) with moderate complexity (wmc=9). Cohesion is low (lcom=0.7777777777777778), and there is only one field (nof=1, nopf=0), which indicates methods do not share state and likely implement multiple responsibilities that could be separated. The depth of inheritance (dit=4) increases the chance that responsibilities have been accumulated. These metrics together justify further decomposition to reduce complexity and improve cohesion."
