    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: class is very small and simple (loc=10, nom=1, wmc=1), has few fields (nof=2, nopf=2), shows high cohesion (lcom=0.0), and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel). These metrics indicate no need for further decomposition; the DIT=3 does not by itself imply insufficient modularization."
