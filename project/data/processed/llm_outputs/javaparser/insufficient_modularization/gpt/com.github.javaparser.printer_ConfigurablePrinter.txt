    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: loc=4, nom=2, wmc=2, nc=2, nof=0. It has minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two dependencies. Depth of inheritance is low (dit=1) and cohesion indicator (lcom=-1.0) does not suggest dispersed responsibilities. Given the tiny size and low complexity, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further — splitting it would not reduce complexity or size."
