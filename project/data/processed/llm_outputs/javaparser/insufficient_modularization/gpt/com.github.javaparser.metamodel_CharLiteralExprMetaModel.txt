    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics show no evidence of insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=8), minimal behavioral complexity (WMC=1), only one method (nom=1) and no fields (nof=0), high cohesion (lcom=-1.0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These indicate the class is already small and focused; there is no indication that it should be further decomposed. Although DIT=5 is deep, considered in isolation it does not by itself imply the class needs decomposition."
