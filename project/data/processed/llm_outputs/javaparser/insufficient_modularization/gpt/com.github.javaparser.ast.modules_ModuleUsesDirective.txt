    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.modules.ModuleUsesDirective",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a relatively large number of methods (nom = 19) and a high cyclomatic/weighted complexity (wmc = 25) concentrated in a small source size (loc = 91), indicating dense, complex behavior. Cohesion is low (lcom = 0.7368421052631579), meaning methods likely do not operate on a common set of instance data. The class has very little state (nof = 1) yet many methods, which suggests the functionality could be split into smaller, more focused classes or helpers. The depth of inheritance (dit = 4) can further increase complexity and argues for simplifying responsibilities. These metrics collectively justify flagging insufficient modularization and recommend decomposition."
