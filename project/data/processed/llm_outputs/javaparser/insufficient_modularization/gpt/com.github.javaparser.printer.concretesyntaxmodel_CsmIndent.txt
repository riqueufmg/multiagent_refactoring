    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=14, NOM=4 and NOPM=4 indicate few methods, WMC=4 indicates low complexity, LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion, DIT=1 minimal inheritance depth, FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 show no coupling pressure. These metrics do not indicate an insufficiently modularized class that requires further decomposition."
