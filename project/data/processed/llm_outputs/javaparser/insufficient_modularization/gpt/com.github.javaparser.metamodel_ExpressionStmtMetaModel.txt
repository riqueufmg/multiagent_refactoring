    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=9, WMC=1, number of fields=1, number of methods=1. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on PropertyMetaModel). These metrics indicate no need for further decomposition; the class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
