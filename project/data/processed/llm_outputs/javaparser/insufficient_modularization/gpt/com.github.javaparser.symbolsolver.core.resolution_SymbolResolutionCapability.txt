    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=11, NOM=1, WMC=1. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only two external type dependencies. Given the low size and complexity metrics there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further or that further decomposition would reduce size/complexity."
