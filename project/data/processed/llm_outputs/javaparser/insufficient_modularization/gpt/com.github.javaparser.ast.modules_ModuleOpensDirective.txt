    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: 21 methods (nom=21) in a relatively small file (loc=114) with a high cyclomatic/weighted method complexity (wmc=32) indicates concentrated implementation complexity. LCOM=0.6667 suggests moderate/low cohesion (methods are not tightly related), and there are only 2 fields (nof=2) supporting many methods, a common indicator that the class encodes multiple responsibilities rather than distinct stateful components. Depth of inheritance (dit=4) increases conceptual complexity in the same class. The combination of high method count, elevated WMC, moderate LCOM, few fields, and deep inheritance justifies that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
