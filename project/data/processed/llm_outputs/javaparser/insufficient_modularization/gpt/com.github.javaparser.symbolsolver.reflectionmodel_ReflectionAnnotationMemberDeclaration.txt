    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=69, NOM=5, NOF=3. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Complexity is moderate (WMC=12) distributed across few methods (average complexity ~2.4), so there is no clear single large responsibility to split. Although DIT=4 indicates inheritance depth, that alone does not imply an undecomposed class. Given the limited size, number of methods/fields and high cohesion, there is insufficient evidence to label this class as Insufficient Modularization."
