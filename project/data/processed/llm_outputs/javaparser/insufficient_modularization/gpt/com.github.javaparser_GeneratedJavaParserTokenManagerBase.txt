    "class": "com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParserTokenManagerBase",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has only 4 methods (nom=4) and 59 lines of code (loc=59), indicating a small size. Although WMC is 14, that level of complexity across 4 methods does not by itself imply an undecomposed class. Cohesion appears high (lcom=-1.0) and there is no evidence of high coupling or many dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the low method count, modest LOC, and good cohesion, there is insufficient evidence to classify this class as suffering from Insufficient Modularization."
