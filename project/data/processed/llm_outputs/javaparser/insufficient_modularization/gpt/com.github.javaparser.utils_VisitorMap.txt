    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: class has moderate size and complexity (loc=72, nom=13, wmc=13) and shows good cohesion (lcom=0.2307692307692307). There are no public fields (nopf=0) and no coupling indicators in the provided data (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies count=1). Given the moderate LOC/WMC and low LCOM, the class does not exhibit signs that it has not been decomposed; further modularization is not justified based on the provided metrics."
