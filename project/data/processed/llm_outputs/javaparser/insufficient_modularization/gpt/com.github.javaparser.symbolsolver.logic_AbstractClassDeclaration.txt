    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition: LOC=40 and NOM=5 show the class is small; WMC=7 indicates only moderate complexity; LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion; NOF=0 (no fields) and fanin=0/fanout=0 indicate low coupling; only 2 external dependencies listed. Although DIT=5 is relatively deep, the small size and cohesion imply responsibilities are concentrated and manageable, so there is no clear evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
