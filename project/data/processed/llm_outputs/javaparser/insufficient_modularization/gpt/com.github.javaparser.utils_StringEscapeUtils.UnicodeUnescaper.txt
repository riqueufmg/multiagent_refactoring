    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being too large or complex in isolation: LOC=33, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, LCOM=-1.0 (not applicable due to no members), fanin=0, fanout=0, and no dependencies. There are no methods or fields to decompose further, so there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
