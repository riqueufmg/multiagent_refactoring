    "justification": "Class has 10 methods (nom=10) but only 1 public method (nopm=1), implying many internal helper methods; moderate complexity (wmc=14) within a small file (loc=66) concentrates behavior; cohesion is limited (lcom=0.6) indicating methods are not tightly related; no fields (nopf=0) and no inheritance (dit=0) point to a flat class bundling multiple behaviors; dependencies on multiple AST types (NodeList, Expression, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, MethodDeclaration, CallableDeclaration) suggest it handles several concerns. These signs indicate insufficient modularization and that further decomposition could reduce size and complexity."
