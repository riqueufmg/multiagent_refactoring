    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=19, WMC=4, number of methods=3, number of fields=2. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. No external coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its low size and complexity, there is no evidence that it has not been decomposed further or that splitting it would reduce complexity—insufficient modularization is not detected."
