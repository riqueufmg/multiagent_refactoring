    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being too large and complex for a single module: LOC = 204 and NOM = 28 indicate substantial size/behavior; WMC = 56 indicates high implementation complexity (many or complex methods). It has relatively few fields (NOF = 5) but many methods, suggesting behavior-heavy responsibilities that could be separated. DIT = 5 increases conceptual complexity and potential responsibility spread. LCOM = 0.428 (moderate cohesion) does not confirm single-responsibility strong cohesion despite the size. The number and variety of dependencies (multiple AST, visitor, resolution and token-related types) imply the class touches multiple concerns. Together these metrics suggest the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
