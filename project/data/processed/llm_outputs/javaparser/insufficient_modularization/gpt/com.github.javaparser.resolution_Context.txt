    "justification": "Multiple indicators point to insufficient modularization: large size (loc=214) with many methods (nom=26) and high complexity (wmc=40) — suggesting multiple responsibilities that could be split; DIT=0 and nc=1 indicate no inheritance-based decomposition is used; fanin=0 and fanout=0 show the class concentrates functionality internally rather than delegating. (LCOM=-1.0 appears invalid/unreliable, so the decision is based on size and complexity metrics.)"
