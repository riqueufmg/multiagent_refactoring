    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=26, WMC=0, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=1 (single field). No incoming/outgoing couplings (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. In isolation there is no evidence of a large, complex class that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
