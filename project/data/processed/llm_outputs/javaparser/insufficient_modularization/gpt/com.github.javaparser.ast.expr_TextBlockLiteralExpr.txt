    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it defines a large number of methods (nom = 19) with many publicly accessible operations (nopm = 15), has moderate size (loc = 105) and elevated implementation complexity (wmc = 21). Its dependency set is varied (visitor interfaces, meta-model, token range, string escape utility), suggesting the class mixes concerns (AST node behavior, visitor support, string escaping and meta-model interaction) that could be separated. The combination of many public methods and high WMC indicates the class likely has multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
