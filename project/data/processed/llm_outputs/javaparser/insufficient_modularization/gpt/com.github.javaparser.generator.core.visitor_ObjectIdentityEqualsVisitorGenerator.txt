    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=14, NOM=2, WMC=2, indicating low implementation complexity and few responsibilities. Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0). Fan-in and fan-out are 0, showing limited coupling. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further or that it would benefit from additional modularization."
