    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=8), single method (nom=1) and low complexity (wmc=1), no fields (nof=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although DIT=5, the class itself is minimal and there is no evidence it should be further decomposed."
