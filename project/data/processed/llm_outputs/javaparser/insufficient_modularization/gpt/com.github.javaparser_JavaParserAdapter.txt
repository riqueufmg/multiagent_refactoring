    "class": "com.github.javaparser.JavaParserAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a very large public API (nom = 33 methods, nopm = 32 non-private methods) concentrated in a small source file (loc = 116), which indicates many responsibilities packed into a single class; complexity is non-trivial (wmc = 34) for one class and would likely be reduced by splitting responsibilities; it depends on a wide variety of AST node types and parser-related types (e.g. AnnotationExpr, ImportDeclaration, ParserConfiguration, Parameter, VariableDeclarationExpr, JavadocParser, PackageDeclaration, Statement, TypeParameter, ArrayInitializerExpr, ClassOrInterfaceType, Name, MethodDeclaration, Type, TypeDeclaration, ExplicitConstructorInvocationStmt, BodyDeclaration, ParseResult, SimpleName, CompilationUnit, BlockStmt, ModuleDirective, JavaParser, ModuleDeclaration, javadoc.Javadoc), suggesting it handles many different parsing/conversion concerns; despite low field count (nof = 1) and low LCOM (0.0606), the combination of many public methods, moderate complexity, and wide dependency surface supports that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from modularization."
