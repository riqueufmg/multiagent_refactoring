    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=46, NOM=12, WMC=12 (complexity proportional to methods) and LCOM=-1.0 indicating high cohesion. No external coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although DIT=5 shows deep inheritance, the class size and cohesion do not suggest it requires further decomposition. Therefore insufficient modularization is not detected."
