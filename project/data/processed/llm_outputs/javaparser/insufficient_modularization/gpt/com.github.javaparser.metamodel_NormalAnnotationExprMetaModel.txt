    "justification": "Class is small and well-factored: LOC=9, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=1 indicate very low size and complexity. LCOM=0.0 implies high cohesion. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 with a single declared dependency (PropertyMetaModel) show minimal coupling. Although DIT=4 is relatively deep, the other metrics show no evidence that the class has not been decomposed; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
