    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization. Metrics show it is small and simple: LOC=29, number of fields nof=1, number of methods nom=0, no public fields nopf=0, no PM nopm=0, weighted method complexity wmc=0, depth of inheritance dit=0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0, and no dependencies. These values indicate minimal size, no behavioral complexity, and no coupling that would suggest it should be further decomposed."
