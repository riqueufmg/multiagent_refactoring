    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=8, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=0; no internal state or multiple responsibilities to split (no fields and only one method); low coupling: fanin=0, fanout=0, no dependencies; cohesion not indicating fragmentation (LCOM=-1.0). Given these metrics, there is no evidence this class is insufficiently modularized or that further decomposition is needed."
