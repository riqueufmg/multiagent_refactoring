    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.YieldStmt",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively high number of methods (nom = 14, nopm = 14) and an appreciable implementation size (loc = 73) combined with a non-trivial cyclomatic/weight measure (wmc = 18). Cohesion is low (lcom = 0.714) while it declares very few fields (nof = 1), indicating many methods operate on limited or different subsets of state (multiple responsibilities). The depth in the inheritance tree (dit = 4) and the method/membership counts increase complexity without compensating cohesion. These factors suggest the class has not been fully decomposed and could be split to reduce size and implementation complexity."
