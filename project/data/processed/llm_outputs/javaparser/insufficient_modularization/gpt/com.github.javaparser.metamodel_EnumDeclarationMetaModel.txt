    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=10, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=2. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency: PropertyMetaModel). Although DIT=4, the class size and complexity metrics indicate it is already well modularized and does not require further decomposition."
