    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has non-trivial size and complexity (LOC=247, WMC=39, NOM=19), its cohesion and coupling metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, multi-responsibility class. LCOM=0.263 indicates reasonable cohesion among methods, fanin/fanout=0 show low external coupling, and DIT=1 implies no deep inheritance that would mask hidden responsibilities. Taken in isolation, these metrics suggest the class is cohesive rather than insufficiently modularized, so no smell detected."
