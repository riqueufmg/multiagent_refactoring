    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows indicators of insufficient modularization: it declares 17 methods (nom=17, nopm=17) while its size is moderate (LOC=96) but its complexity is high (WMC=25). Cohesion is relatively low (LCOM=0.588), suggesting multiple responsibilities or weakly related methods that could be split. The presence of several external dependencies (listed in input) and a non-trivial inheritance depth (DIT=4) further increase conceptual complexity. These combined metrics (high method count and complexity with low cohesion) justify recommending further decomposition."
