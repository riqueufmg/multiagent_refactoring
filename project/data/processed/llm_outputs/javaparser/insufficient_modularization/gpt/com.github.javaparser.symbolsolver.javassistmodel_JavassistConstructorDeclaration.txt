    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistConstructorDeclaration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of Insufficient Modularization when considered in isolation. It is small (49 LOC) with a modest number of methods (nom = 13) and a proportionate complexity (wmc = 13, i.e. average complexity ≈1 per method). Cohesion is acceptable (lcom = 0.3077) and it has few fields (nof = 3). There is no measured external coupling in the provided metrics (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Although the inheritance depth (dit = 4) and listed dependencies exist, these do not, by themselves, indicate an overlarge or monolithic class that should be further decomposed given the small size and reasonable cohesion/complexity metrics above."
