    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High implementation size and complexity: LOC=162 and WMC=45 indicate a large, complex class. Large public API and behavior concentration: NOM=25 and NOPM=25 show many methods (all public), suggesting multiple responsibilities. Moderate cohesion: LCOM=0.48 signals that methods are not highly cohesive, supporting the idea of separable responsibilities. Small number of fields (NOF=3) combined with many methods implies significant behavior is implemented inside the class rather than delegated to collaborators. Given these metrics in isolation, the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and complexity."
