    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=46, NOF=1, NOM=10, WMC=10, LCOM=0.0. It has no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one external dependency. Given the low size, moderate complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modular or needs further decomposition."
