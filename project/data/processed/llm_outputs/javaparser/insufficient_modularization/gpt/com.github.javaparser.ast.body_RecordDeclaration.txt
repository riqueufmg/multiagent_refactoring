    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it is relatively large and complex (LOC = 220, WMC = 58) with many methods (NOM = 29, NOPM = 29), while having few fields (NOF = 4). Cohesion is moderate (LCOM = 0.5517), indicating the methods are not highly focused on a single cohesive responsibility. The combination of high method count and complexity with only a small state footprint suggests the class is implementing multiple responsibilities that could be split into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity. The depth of inheritance (DIT = 5) further increases class complexity and supports decomposing responsibilities. These elements together justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
