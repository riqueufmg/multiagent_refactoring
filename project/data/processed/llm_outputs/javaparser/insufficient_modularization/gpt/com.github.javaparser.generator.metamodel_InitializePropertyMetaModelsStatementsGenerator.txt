    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=35, WMC=5, NOM=5. It has no fields (NOF=0) and no measured coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM is not indicating poor cohesion (no fields to decompose). Given the low size, low complexity, few methods, and lack of internal state, there is no evidence in the provided metrics that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
