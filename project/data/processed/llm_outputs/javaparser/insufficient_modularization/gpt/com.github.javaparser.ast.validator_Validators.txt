    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=30, WMC=7 (low complexity), 6 methods (NOPM=6) and only 1 field (NOF=1). LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its small size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
