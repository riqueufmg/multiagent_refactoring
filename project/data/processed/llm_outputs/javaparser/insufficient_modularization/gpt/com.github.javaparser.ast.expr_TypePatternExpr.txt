    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.TypePatternExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a relatively large number of methods (nom = 17) packed into a small file (loc = 106) with a high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc = 28). Cohesion is low/moderate (lcom = 0.588) while the number of fields is small (nof = 2), indicating many methods do not operate on a shared small state (suggesting multiple responsibilities). Additionally the deep inheritance (dit = 6) increases conceptual complexity. Together these metrics (high nom and wmc, low cohesion, few fields, deep DIT) indicate the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
