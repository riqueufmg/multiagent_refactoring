    "class": "box.Foo",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has extremely small size and no internal complexity: loc=2, nom=0 (no methods), nof=0 (no fields), wmc=0, nc=0. Coupling is zero (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. LCOM is -1.0 (not applicable given no members). These metrics indicate the class is minimal rather than insufficiently modularized, so no detection of Insufficient Modularization."
