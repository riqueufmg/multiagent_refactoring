    "justification": "Metrics show a trivial/small class: LOC=5, WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPM=0, NC=1, fan-in=0, fan-out=0, dependencies=[]. There are no methods or fields to decompose and implementation complexity is zero, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization. (DIT=11 is noted but the class itself contains no behavior to further split.)"
