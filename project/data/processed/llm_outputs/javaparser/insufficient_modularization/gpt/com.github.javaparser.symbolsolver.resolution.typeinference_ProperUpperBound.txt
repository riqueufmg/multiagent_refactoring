    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive, so further decomposition is not indicated. Metrics: loc=32, nom=6, wmc=9 (moderate complexity), nof=2, lcom=0.0 (high cohesion), fanin=0, fanout=0. It has only 2 dependencies and no inheritance depth (dit=0). These values show limited size, focused responsibility and low coupling, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
