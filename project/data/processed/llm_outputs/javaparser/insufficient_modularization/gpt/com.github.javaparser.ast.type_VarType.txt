    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.VarType",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: 15 methods (14 public) with LOC=87 and WMC=23 indicates concentrated implementation complexity; LCOM≈0.933 suggests low cohesion among methods; there is only 1 field, implying many operations are not organized around distinct state, and DIT=4 increases inherited responsibilities. Together these metrics (high method count and complexity, low cohesion) justify that the class is not fully decomposed and could be refactored into smaller, more cohesive units."
