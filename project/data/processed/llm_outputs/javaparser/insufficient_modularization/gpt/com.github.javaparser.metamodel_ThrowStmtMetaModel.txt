    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=9, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=1, NOPF=1, NOPM=0, LCOM=0.0, fanin=0, fanout=0. These metrics indicate low size and low complexity with high cohesion; there is no evidence it requires further decomposition. DIT=3 and single dependency do not by themselves justify additional modularization."
