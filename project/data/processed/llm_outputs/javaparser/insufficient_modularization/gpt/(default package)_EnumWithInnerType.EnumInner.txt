    "justification": "The class is extremely small and contains no methods or fields (loc=2, nom=0, nopf=0), has zero complexity (wmc=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). LCOM is not meaningful here (-1.0) due to absence of members. Given its minimal size and lack of implementation complexity, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
