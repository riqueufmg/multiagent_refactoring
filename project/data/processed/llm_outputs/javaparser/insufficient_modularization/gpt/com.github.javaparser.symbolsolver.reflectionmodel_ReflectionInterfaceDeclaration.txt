    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionInterfaceDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows characteristics of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc=312) and high complexity (wmc=70) with a large number of methods (nom=38) and a very large public API surface (nopm=30). It defines very few fields (nof=3) while providing many behaviors, which suggests the class is behavior-heavy and may be combining multiple responsibilities rather than delegating them. Deep inheritance (dit=5) increases conceptual complexity in isolation. Although LCOM is low (0.184), indicating internal cohesion, the combination of high LOC, high WMC, and many public methods supports that further decomposition into smaller, focused classes or collaborators could reduce size and complexity. The number of external dependencies (15) also indicates multiple responsibilities or interactions that could be modularized."
