    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=19, NOM=4, WMC=4. Cohesion appears good (LCOM=-1.0) and there are no field counts or external coupling (NOF=0, NOPF=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0). Although DIT=3, the class size and complexity do not indicate it needs further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
