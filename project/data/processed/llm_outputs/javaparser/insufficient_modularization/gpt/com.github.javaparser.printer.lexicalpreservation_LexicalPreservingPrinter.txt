    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.LexicalPreservingPrinter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 592) and high complexity (wmc = 63) indicate it implements many responsibilities and is hard to maintain. It has 14 methods (nom = 14) but only 4 public methods (nopm = 4), implying many internal/private methods (≈10) which often signals internal decomposition opportunity. The class depends on many external types (long dependency list including JavaToken, Node, Comment, ConcreteSyntaxModel, LexicalDifferenceCalculator, etc.), suggesting it coordinates multiple concerns. Although LCOM = 0.214 (reasonable cohesion), the combination of high LOC, high WMC, many non-public methods and numerous dependencies supports that the class could be further decomposed into smaller, focused modules to reduce size and complexity."
