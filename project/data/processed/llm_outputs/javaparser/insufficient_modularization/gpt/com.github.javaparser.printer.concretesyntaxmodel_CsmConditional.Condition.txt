    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmConditional.Condition",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=24), no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), zero cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=0), and no coupling to or from other units (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM is not applicable (lcom=-1). These metrics indicate the class is trivial/compact and does not require further decomposition."
