    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.SourceZip",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization. It is small (loc=82) with a low number of fields (nof=2) and methods (nom=7 / nopm=7), moderate cyclomatic complexity (wmc=9), and very high cohesion (lcom=0.0). There are no public fields (nopf=0), no inheritance complexity (dit=0, nc=0), and minimal coupling as indicated by fanin=0 and fanout=0. These metrics indicate the class is sufficiently compact and cohesive, so further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided data."
