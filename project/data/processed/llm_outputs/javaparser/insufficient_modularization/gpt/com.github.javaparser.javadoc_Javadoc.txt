    "justification": "Although the class has 113 LOC, 14 methods and a WMC of 23 (moderate size/complexity), other indicators do not support Insufficient Modularization: LCOM = 0.0 indicates high cohesion, there are only 3 fields, DIT = 0 (no inheritance complexity), fanin/fanout = 0 and only 4 external dependencies. The class appears cohesive with a contained responsibility set, so further decomposition is not clearly warranted."
