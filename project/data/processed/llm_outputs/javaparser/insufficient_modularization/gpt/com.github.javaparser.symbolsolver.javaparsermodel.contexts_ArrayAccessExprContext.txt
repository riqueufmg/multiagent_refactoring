    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=12, NOM=2, NOPM=2 and WMC=2 indicate very low size and complexity. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show no significant coupling to decompose, and only three listed dependent types (com.github.javaparser.resolution.TypeSolver, com.github.javaparser.resolution.model.SymbolReference, com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.ArrayAccessExpr) do not imply internal responsibility bloat. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class has not been fully decomposed or that further modularization is needed."
