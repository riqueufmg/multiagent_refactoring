    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistEnumDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high method count (nom = 28, of which nopm = 26 are public) and high complexity (wmc = 40) while being relatively large (loc = 136). It has few fields (nof = 3) but many behavioral members, indicating a behavior-heavy class that likely mixes multiple responsibilities. The dependency list (JavassistUtils, JavassistClassDeclaration, JavassistTypeDeclarationAdapter, JavassistFactory, and several resolution/type-related interfaces) suggests the class interacts with multiple roles (adapter/factory/utilities/resolution), which are candidates for extraction. Although LCOM = 0.0 indicates good internal cohesion, the combination of many public methods and high WMC implies the class could be decomposed into smaller helper/delegate classes to reduce size and complexity."
