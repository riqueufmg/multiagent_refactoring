    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=4, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0. It has no fields and a single method, minimal implementation complexity, low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1). Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
