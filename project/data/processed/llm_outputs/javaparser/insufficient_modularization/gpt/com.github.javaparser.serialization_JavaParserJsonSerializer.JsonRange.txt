    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=8, nof=1 (single field), nom=0 and nopf=0 (no methods), WMC=0 (no complexity). Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 indicate no coupling to decompose. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or that it should be further decomposed."
