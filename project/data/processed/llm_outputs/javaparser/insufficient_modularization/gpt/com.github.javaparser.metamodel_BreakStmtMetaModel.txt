    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=9, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=1. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on PropertyMetaModel). Although DIT=3, the class size and low complexity indicate it is already sufficiently modular and does not require further decomposition."
