    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=13, WMC=1, NOM=1, LCOM=0.0. It has low coupling and impact: fanin=0, fanout=0, only one dependency. Despite having 5 fields (NOF=5), the very low method/complexity counts and high cohesion indicate it does not need further decomposition; there is no evidence of excessive size or implementation complexity that would justify Insufficient Modularization."
