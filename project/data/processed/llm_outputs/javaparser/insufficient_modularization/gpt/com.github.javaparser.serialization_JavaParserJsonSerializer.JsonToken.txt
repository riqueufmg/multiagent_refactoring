    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=8, number of fields=1, number of methods=0, WMC=0, fan-in=0, fan-out=0. With a single field, no methods, zero complexity and no dependencies, there is no evidence this class has not been decomposed further; it does not exhibit the size or implementation complexity indicative of Insufficient Modularization."
