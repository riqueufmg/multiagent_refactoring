    "class": "com.github.javaparser.TokenRange",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Analyzed in isolation, the class does not show clear signs of insufficient modularization: LOC is small (61), number of methods is moderate (nom=10) and methods are compact, complexity is only moderately elevated (WMC=18) but not excessive for 10 methods, cohesion is high (LCOM=0.2) indicating a single, focused responsibility, field count is small (nof=5 with only nopf=1 public field), and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency com.github.javaparser.JavaToken). These metrics indicate the class is compact and cohesive, so further decomposition is not clearly justified from the provided data."
