    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.TypedValidator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=18, NOM=3, WMC=3. Cohesion appears strong (LCOM=-1.0) and inheritance depth is 0 (DIT=0). External coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there is only 1 public method (NOPM=1). Given the low size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further — it does not exhibit the size or complexity symptoms of Insufficient Modularization."
