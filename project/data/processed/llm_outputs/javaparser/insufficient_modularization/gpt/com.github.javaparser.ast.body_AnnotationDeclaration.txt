    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 14 methods (nom=14) but only 52 LOC and WMC=14, indicating methods are small and overall complexity is moderate. LCOM=-1.0 suggests high cohesion, and fanin=0 / fanout=0 indicate low coupling. Although DIT=5 shows a deep inheritance chain, there is no evidence of a large, monolithic implementation or low cohesion that would indicate an opportunity for further decomposition. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
