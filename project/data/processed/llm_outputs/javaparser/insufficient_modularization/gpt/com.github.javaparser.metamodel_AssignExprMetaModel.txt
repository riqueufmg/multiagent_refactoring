    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=11, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=3. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on PropertyMetaModel). These metrics indicate a single, cohesive responsibility with low complexity, so there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
