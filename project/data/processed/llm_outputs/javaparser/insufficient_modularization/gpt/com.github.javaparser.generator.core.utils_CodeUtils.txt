    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.utils.CodeUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class analyzed in isolation shows no sign of Insufficient Modularization: very small size (LOC=16), few methods (NOM=2, public methods=1), low complexity (WMC=3), high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0), and minimal coupling (FANOUT=0, single external dependency). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and cohesive, so further decomposition is not justified."
