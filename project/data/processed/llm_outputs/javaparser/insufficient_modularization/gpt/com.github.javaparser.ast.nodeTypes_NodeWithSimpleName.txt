    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=17, NOM=5 and WMC=5 indicate low size and low complexity; NOF=0 (no fields) and LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion) show the class responsibilities are focused. DIT=0 and low coupling indications (fanin=0, fanout=0) further imply simple structure. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
