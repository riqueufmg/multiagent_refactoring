    "justification": "The class is small and simple: loc=12, nom=2, nof=1, wmc=2. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, 1 dependency). Although lcom=1.0 indicates low cohesion, the overall low size and complexity mean there is little to decompose further. DIT=3 does not by itself imply the class contains multiple unrelated responsibilities. Therefore there is no strong evidence of Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
