    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.modifiers.NodeWithFinalModifier",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has very small size and complexity (loc=14, nom=2, wmc=2), no fields (nof=0), no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), shallow inheritance (dit=1) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and cohesive, so there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
