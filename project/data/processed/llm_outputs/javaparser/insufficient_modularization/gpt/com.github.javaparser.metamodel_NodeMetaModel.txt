    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=12, NOM=2, NOF=1, WMC=2. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency: com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel). Depth of inheritance (DIT=1) is shallow. Although LCOM=1.0 might hint at cohesion concerns, the very small size and method count mean there is no evidence the class has not been decomposed; no substantial size or complexity indicators justify marking it as Insufficient Modularization."
