    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.AstObserver",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (LOC=33), few methods (NOM=4), low complexity (WMC=4), no fields (NOF=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), shallow hierarchy (DIT=0) and high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). These metrics indicate the class is small, focused and not a candidate for further decomposition."
