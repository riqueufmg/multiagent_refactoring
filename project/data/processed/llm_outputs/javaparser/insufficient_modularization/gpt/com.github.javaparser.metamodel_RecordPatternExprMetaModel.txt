    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=10, WMC=1, NOM=1, 2 fields (NOF=2) and high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). Fan-out=0 and fan-in=0 indicate no coupling pressure suggesting need for decomposition. Although DIT=5, there is no size or complexity evidence (low LOC/WMC/NOM) that further modularization would reduce complexity or size. Dependency count is minimal (1). Therefore this class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
