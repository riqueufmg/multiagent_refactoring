    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.LexicalPreservingPrinter.Observer",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large (LOC = 307), which is a primary indicator that it likely contains multiple responsibilities and would benefit from decomposition. Although many method/field counts are not provided, the substantial size alone suggests insufficient modularization. The listed dependencies (com.github.javaparser.utils.LineSeparator, com.github.javaparser.JavaToken, com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.AstObserver, com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.ObservableProperty) indicate the class deals with several distinct concerns (token handling, line separators, and AST observation), supporting the view that responsibilities are mixed. The shallow inheritance depth (DIT = 2) and zero reported external coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) imply splitting the class is unlikely to increase external coupling and could reduce internal complexity. For these reasons the class exhibits the code smell Insufficient Modularization."
