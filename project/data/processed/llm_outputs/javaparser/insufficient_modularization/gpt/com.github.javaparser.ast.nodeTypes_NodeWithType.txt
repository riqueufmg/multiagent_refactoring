    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive — LOC = 34, NOM = 6 and WMC = 6 indicate low size and low complexity. LCOM = -1.0 indicates high cohesion. Coupling appears minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class is large, complex, or insufficiently decomposed; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
