    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=12, wmc=1, nom=1. Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0). Field count is low (nof=4, nopf=4) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency: com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel). Although dit=3, there is no sign of excessive size or complexity that would require further decomposition, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
