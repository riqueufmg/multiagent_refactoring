    "justification": "The class is small and unlikely to suffer from insufficient modularization: LOC = 32, number of methods = 2, WMC = 6 (moderate complexity), LCOM = -1.0 (indicating high cohesion), fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 (low coupling). DIT = 2 is modest. These metrics collectively do not justify further decomposition."
