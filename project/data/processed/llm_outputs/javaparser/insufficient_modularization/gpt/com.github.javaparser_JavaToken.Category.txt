    "justification": "Class examined in isolation shows no indications of insufficient modularization: loc=31 (small size), nom=0 and nof=0 (no methods or fields to decompose), wmc=0 (no internal complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling/dependencies). Given the minimal size and complexity, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
