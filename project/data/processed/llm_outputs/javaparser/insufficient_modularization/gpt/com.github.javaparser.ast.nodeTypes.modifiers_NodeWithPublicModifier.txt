    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: loc=11, nom=2, wmc=2. It has no fields (nof=0), no package-private methods (nopm=0), and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. With low size, low complexity and low coupling, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
