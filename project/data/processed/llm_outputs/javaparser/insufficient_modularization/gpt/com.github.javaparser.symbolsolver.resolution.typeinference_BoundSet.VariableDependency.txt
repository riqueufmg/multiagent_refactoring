    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=17, 2 fields, 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and WMC=0, indicating no internal behavioral complexity to decompose. Low coupling and impact: fanin=0, fanout=0 and only one listed dependency (InferenceVariable). Given the minimal size, zero method complexity, and low coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity — Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
