    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and focused: 65 LOC, 6 methods (NOM=6) and 3 fields (NOF=3). Cyclomatic/implementation complexity is low (WMC=6). Cohesion is reasonable (LCOM=0.333) and inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=1). There are no incoming or outgoing class-level dependencies in the metrics (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggesting the class operates in isolation rather than accumulating unrelated responsibilities. Given the small size, low complexity, and acceptable cohesion, there is no evidence here that the class requires further decomposition."
