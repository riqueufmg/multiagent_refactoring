    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC = 12, WMC = 1, NOM = 1. It has a small number of fields (NOF = 4) and no package-methods (NOPM = 0). Cohesion is high (LCOM = 0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0). These metrics indicate low size and low implementation complexity, so there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
