    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC = 24, NOM = 5, WMC = 5 indicate low size and complexity; NOF = 0 (no fields) and NC = 3 with FANIN = 0 and FANOUT = 0 show minimal coupling and state; LCOM = -1.0 indicates high cohesion. DIT = 3 is moderate but alone does not imply insufficient modularization. Therefore there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized."
