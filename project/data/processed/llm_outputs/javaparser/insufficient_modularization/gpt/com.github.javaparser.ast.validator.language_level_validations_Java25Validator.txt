    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple in isolation: LOC=10, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOPM=1, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, no dependencies. These metrics indicate minimal size and low internal complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further. DIT=28 is high but, taken alone and without other class contexts, does not imply internal modularization issues. LCOM=-1.0 provides no counter-evidence. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
