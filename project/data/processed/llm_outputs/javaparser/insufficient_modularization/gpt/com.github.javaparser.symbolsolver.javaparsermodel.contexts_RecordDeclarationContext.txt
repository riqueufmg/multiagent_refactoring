    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and cohesive. Metrics: loc=58 (small size), nof=1 (single field), nom=9 and nopm=8 (limited number of methods), lcom=0.333 (good cohesion). Although wmc=17 indicates moderate internal complexity, it is not accompanied by large size or many responsibilities that would strongly suggest decomposition. Depth of inheritance dit=2 is shallow and fanin=0/fanout=0 show no heavy coupling. Overall the size and cohesion metrics do not justify marking this class as insufficiently modularized."
