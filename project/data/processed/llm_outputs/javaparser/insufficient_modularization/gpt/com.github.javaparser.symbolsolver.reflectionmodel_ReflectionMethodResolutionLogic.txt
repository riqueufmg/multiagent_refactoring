    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionMethodResolutionLogic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: low number of methods (nom = 3) combined with large size (LOC = 99) and high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (WMC = 24) indicates large, complex methods that likely contain multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed. There are no fields (NOF = 0) so the complexity is concentrated in method implementations rather than distributed state. The class depends on many distinct types from different areas (multiple dependencies listed), suggesting it handles multiple concerns. These metrics together justify recommending further decomposition into smaller, focused classes or helper components."
