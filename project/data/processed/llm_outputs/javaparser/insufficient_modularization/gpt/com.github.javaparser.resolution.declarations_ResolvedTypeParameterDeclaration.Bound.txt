    "justification": "False — metrics indicate a small, simple class with no methods and minimal structure: loc=56, nof=2 (two fields), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, and a single dependency (com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedType). LCOM is not informative (-1.0). There is no evidence of multiple responsibilities, high complexity, or sufficient size that would suggest further decomposition."
