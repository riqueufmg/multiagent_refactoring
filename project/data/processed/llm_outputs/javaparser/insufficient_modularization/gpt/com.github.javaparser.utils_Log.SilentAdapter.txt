    "justification": "Class has very low size and complexity (loc=11, nom=0, nof=0, wmc=0, nc=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no dependencies. There are no methods or fields to further decompose; given its minimal implementation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
