    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: LOC is very small (loc=5), there are no methods (nom=0) and no fields (nof=0), cyclomatic/implementation complexity is zero (wmc=0), and there are no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The small size and lack of responsibilities indicate no further decomposition is warranted."
