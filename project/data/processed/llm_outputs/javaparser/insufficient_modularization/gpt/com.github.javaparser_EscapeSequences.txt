    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=13, NOM=1 (only one method), WMC=3 (low complexity), NOF=0 and NOPF=0 (no fields), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling), LCOM=-1.0 (no indication of low cohesion). These metrics indicate the class is simple and sufficiently modular in isolation."
