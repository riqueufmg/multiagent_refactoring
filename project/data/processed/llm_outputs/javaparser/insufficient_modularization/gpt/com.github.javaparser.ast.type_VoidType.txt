    "justification": "Class size and complexity do not indicate a need for further decomposition: LOC=55 (small), WMC=15 with NOM=15 (average cyclomatic complexity ≈1 per method), NOF=0 (no fields) and fanin=0/fanout=0 (low coupling). Although NOM=15 is non‑trivial, methods are small and cohesive evidence is inconclusive (LCOM=-1.0 is unavailable/invalid). DIT=4 shows inheritance depth rather than internal bloat. Overall metrics do not meet the usual indicators of Insufficient Modularization (large LOC, high complexity per method, many responsibilities or low cohesion)."
