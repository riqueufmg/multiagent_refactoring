    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: loc=32, nom=4, wmc=7 and only nopm=1 public method. It has shallow inheritance (dit=1), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no external dependencies beyond listed types. These metrics indicate the class is already compact and cohesive, so there is no evidence it has not been decomposed further or that it would benefit from additional modularization."
