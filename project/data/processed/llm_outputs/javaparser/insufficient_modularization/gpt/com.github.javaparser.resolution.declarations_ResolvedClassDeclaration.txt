    "justification": "Not detected. The class is small and not complex: LOC=32, WMC=6, NOM=6, NOF=0. Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0). There is no coupling evidence (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no fields to split out. Although DIT=4, the class size and complexity metrics do not indicate a candidate for further decomposition."
