    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmElement",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: a large number of methods (nom = 30) combined with high cyclomatic/weighted complexity (wmc = 30) in a relatively small source span (loc = 90) indicates many responsibilities concentrated in one class. dit = 0 (no inheritance decomposition) and the class has multiple external dependencies (com.github.javaparser.printer.SourcePrinter, com.github.javaparser.TokenTypes, com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.TextElement, com.github.javaparser.utils.LineSeparator, com.github.javaparser.ast.Node, com.github.javaparser.ast.observer.ObservableProperty, com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmConditional, com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParserConstants), which suggests it interacts with varied concerns. The cohesion metric is unavailable/uncertain (lcom = -1.0), so the high method count and complexity are the primary indicators that the class could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes or components."
