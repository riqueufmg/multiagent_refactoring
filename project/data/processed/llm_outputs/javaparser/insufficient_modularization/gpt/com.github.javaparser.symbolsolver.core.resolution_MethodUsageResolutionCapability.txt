    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=3, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0. It has no fields, no internal complexity and no fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition; therefore there is no indication of Insufficient Modularization."
