    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=44, nom=8, nof=3. Complexity is moderate but not excessive (wmc=10) and cohesion is good (lcom=0.25). There is no evidence of high coupling or many responsibilities (fanin=0, fanout=0, only the listed dependencies). DIT=3 does not by itself indicate a need for further decomposition. Based on these metrics the class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
