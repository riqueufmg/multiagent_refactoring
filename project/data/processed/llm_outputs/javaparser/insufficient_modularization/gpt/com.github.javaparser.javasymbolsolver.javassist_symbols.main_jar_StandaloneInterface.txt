    "justification": "Class is very small and shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: nom=0 and nopm=0 (no methods to decompose), loc=4 (very low size), wmc=0 (no complexity), nof=2 and nopf=2 (only two fields), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling to suggest a large responsibility), lcom=-1.0 (no cohesion indication of a large mixed responsibility). These metrics indicate the class is too small/simple to warrant further decomposition."
