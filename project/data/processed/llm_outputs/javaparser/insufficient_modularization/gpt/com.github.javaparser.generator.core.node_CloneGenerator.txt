    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.node.CloneGenerator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and cohesive: LOC=10, number of methods (nom)=2 and number of public methods (nopm)=1, weighted method count (wmc)=2, LCOM=-1.0 indicating high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Depth of inheritance (dit=2) is modest but does not by itself indicate a need for further decomposition. Given the low size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization in isolation."
