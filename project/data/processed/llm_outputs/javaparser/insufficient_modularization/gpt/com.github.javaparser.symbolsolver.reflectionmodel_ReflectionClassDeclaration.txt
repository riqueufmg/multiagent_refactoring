    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionClassDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows multiple indicators of Insufficient Modularization: high size and complexity (loc = 223, WMC = 64), a large number of methods (nom = 35, nopm = 34) suggesting many responsibilities, and a deep inheritance level (DIT = 6) which increases conceptual complexity. It also depends on many distinct types (19 listed dependencies) including factories, adapters, comparators, method/field/model resolution and type solver classes, which implies it is mixing several concerns (reflection model, method resolution, adapters, comparators). Although LCOM = 0.2 does not show strong lack of cohesion, the combination of high method count, high complexity, large LOC, and broad dependency surface indicates the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would likely benefit from further modularization (extracting responsibilities into smaller classes/components)."
