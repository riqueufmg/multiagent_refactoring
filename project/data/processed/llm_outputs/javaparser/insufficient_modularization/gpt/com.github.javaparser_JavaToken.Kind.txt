    "class": "com.github.javaparser.JavaToken.Kind",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 169) while having no methods (nom = 0, nopm = 0) and only one field (nof = 1), indicating substantial inline content (likely many constants) that has not been decomposed. Complexity metrics are minimal (wmc = 0), and there are no dependencies (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), so the class is self-contained but bulky. These factors together justify that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
