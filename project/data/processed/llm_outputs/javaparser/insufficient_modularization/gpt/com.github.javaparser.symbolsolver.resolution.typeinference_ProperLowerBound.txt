    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=32, NOM=6, WMC=9 indicate low size and complexity. LCOM=0.0 shows high cohesion. It has only 2 fields (NOF=2) and no public fields (NOPF=0), no inheritance depth (DIT=0), and no external coupling (fanout=0, fanin=0) with only two dependencies. These metrics indicate the class does not need further decomposition (no evidence of an oversized or multifaceted responsibility)."
