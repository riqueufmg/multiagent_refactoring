    "justification": "Class has very small size and complexity (loc=4, wmc=0), no methods or fields (nom=0, nof=0, nopf=0), zero coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no inheritance depth (dit=0). These metrics indicate the class is minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
