    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: loc=9, nom=2, wmc=2, nof=1, nopm=2, lcom=0.0 (high cohesion), fanin=0, fanout=0. Dependencies are limited (a.b.c.DataObject, a.b.c.DataObjectFactory). These metrics indicate low size and low complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
