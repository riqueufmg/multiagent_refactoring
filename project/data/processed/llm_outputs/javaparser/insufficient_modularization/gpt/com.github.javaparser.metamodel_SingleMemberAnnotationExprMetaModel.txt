    "justification": "The class is very small and low complexity: LOC=9, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=1. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and there is no coupling to other classes (fanout=0). Although DIT=4, the class size and single method/field indicate a single responsibility and no evidence that it needs further decomposition."
