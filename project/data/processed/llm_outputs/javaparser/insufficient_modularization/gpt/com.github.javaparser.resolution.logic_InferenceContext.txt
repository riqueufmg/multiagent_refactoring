    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic.InferenceContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 205) combined with high complexity (WMC = 58) while declaring relatively few methods (NOM = 7, of which NOPM = 4 public). This yields a high average complexity/size per method (~8.3 WMC per method and ~29 LOC per method), indicating large methods and concentrated responsibilities. LCOM = 0.2857 does not indicate extremely poor cohesion and therefore does not rule out decomposition, but given the overall size and complexity the class is a good candidate for splitting. Additional indicators: it uses multiple distinct dependency types (InferenceVariableType, ResolvedType, ResolvedReferenceType, ResolvedWildcard, ResolvedLambdaConstraintType, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, TypeSolver), suggesting it handles several concerns. DIT = 0 and zero fan-in/fan-out in the provided data mean the class is an isolated unit that can be refactored without cross-hierarchy constraints. Taken together, these metrics justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
