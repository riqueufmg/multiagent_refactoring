    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is a candidate for further decomposition: LOC = 166 and WMC = 48 (high implementation complexity), NOM = 13 with NOPM = 5 (8 non-public methods — many internal behaviors), and only NOF = 4 fields (few data members but many behaviors). The dependency set (e.g. MethodResolutionLogic, ConstructorResolutionLogic, TypeSolver, JavaParserFacade, ReflectionClassDeclaration) shows it touches multiple responsibilities (adaptation plus resolution logic). Even though LCOM = 0.1538 implies decent cohesion, the combination of high WMC, substantial method count (mostly non-public), and diverse dependencies supports that the class has not been fully decomposed and could be refactored into smaller modules to reduce size and complexity."
