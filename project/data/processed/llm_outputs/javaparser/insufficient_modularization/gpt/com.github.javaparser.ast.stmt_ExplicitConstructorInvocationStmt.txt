        "High number of methods: nom = 24 (nopm = 24) — many methods (all public) suggesting multiple responsibilities that could be separated.",
        "Relatively large size and complexity: loc = 184 and wmc = 47 — substantial implementation complexity concentrated in a single class.",
        "Moderate cohesion: lcom = 0.4583 — not highly cohesive, indicating methods may not all relate to a single well-focused responsibility.",
        "Shallow coupling externally (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) but substantial internal complexity — suggests opportunities to split internal behavior into smaller collaborator classes without increasing external coupling.",
        "Depth of inheritance (dit = 4) combined with many methods increases maintenance burden and favors decomposition to reduce class size/complexity."
