    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of being monolithic and not fully decomposed: very large size (LOC = 1049) and large number of methods (NOM = 105, NOPM = 103) which indicate many responsibilities; high implementation complexity (WMC = 178) suggesting complex method logic and control flow; it depends on a very large set of AST node types (the dependency list includes many distinct node classes), implying it handles many different cases/concerns; cohesion metric is not favorable (LCOM = -1.0 as reported) and the class has many members (nom/nopm) concentrated in a single unit. Together these elements justify detection of Insufficient Modularization."
