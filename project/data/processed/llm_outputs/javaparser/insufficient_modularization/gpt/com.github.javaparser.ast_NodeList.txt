    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being too large and complex for a single module: very high number of methods (nom=67) with a very large public API (nopm=61); high size and implementation complexity (loc=460, wmc=91). The combination of few fields (nof=5) but many methods suggests the class is behavior-heavy and likely encapsulates multiple responsibilities that could be split. Although cohesion is not extremely poor (lcom=0.208955223880597), the sheer method count, public surface and complexity metrics justify refactoring into smaller, more focused modules."
