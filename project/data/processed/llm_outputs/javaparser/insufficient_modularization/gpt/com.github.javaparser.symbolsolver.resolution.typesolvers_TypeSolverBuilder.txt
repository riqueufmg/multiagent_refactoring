    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization. Although the class has 14 methods (nom=14) and 156 lines (loc=156), its cyclomatic/maintenance complexity is moderate (wmc=16). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0), there is a single field (nof=1, nopf=0) and no measured coupling (fanout=0, fanin=0). No inheritance complexity (dit=0, nc=0). Given moderate size and high cohesion, there is no strong evidence that the class is insufficiently decomposed."
