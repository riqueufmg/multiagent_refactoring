    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=10 and NOM=4 indicate low size; WMC=4 shows low implementation complexity. No fields (NOF=0) and shallow inheritance (DIT=1) reduce need for further decomposition. Cohesion appears adequate (LCOM=-1.0) and there are no external coupling concerns in the given data (FANOUT=0, FANIN=0). Considering the class in isolation, these metrics do not justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
