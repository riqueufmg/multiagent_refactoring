    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=232 (large size), NOM=20 methods (NOPM=13 public), WMC=48 (high complexity) and NOF=8 fields. The high method count, large lines-of-code and elevated complexity indicate multiple responsibilities or implementation complexity that could be reduced by decomposition. Although LCOM=0.0 suggests cohesion, the overall size and complexity metrics (LOC, NOM, WMC, public surface) justify recommending further modularization."
