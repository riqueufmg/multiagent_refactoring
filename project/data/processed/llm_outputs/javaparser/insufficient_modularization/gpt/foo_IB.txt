    "class": "foo.IB",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: nom=2 methods, loc=6 lines, wmc=2 (low complexity), nof=0 fields. LCOM=-1.0 (not applicable/no state), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling). Given the very small size, low complexity, and absence of fields/state, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
