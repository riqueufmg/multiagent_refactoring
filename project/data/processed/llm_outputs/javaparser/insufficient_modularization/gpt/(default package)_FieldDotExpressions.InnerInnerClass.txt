    "justification": "Class is very small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=6, NOM=0 (no methods), WMC=0 (no complexity), NOF=2 (only two fields), FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 (no coupling/dependencies), DIT=0 (no inheritance depth). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems in this tiny class. These metrics show low size and complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
