    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=13, WMC=1, NOM=1, LCOM=0.0. It has low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single listed dependency), and only a few fields (NOF=5) with no complex methods (NOPF=5, NOPM=0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and well decomposed, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
