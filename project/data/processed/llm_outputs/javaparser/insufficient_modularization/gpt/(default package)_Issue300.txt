    "class": "(default package).Issue300",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and contains no behavior that suggests further decomposition: LOC=10, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1. It has no outgoing or incoming coupling (fanout=0, fanin=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
