    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: loc=8, nom=3, wmc=3 (low complexity), lcom=-1.0 (high cohesion). fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no coupling pressures suggesting unmet decomposition needs. Given the low size and complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
