    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it declares 6 fields (nof=6, nopf=6) but only 2 methods (nom=2) and 17 LOC, indicating a data-heavy class with few behaviors. Cohesion is low (LCOM=1.0), which means the methods do not uniformly operate on the same set of fields and suggests multiple responsibilities that could be split. Complexity metrics are low (WMC=2) but the mismatch between many fields and few methods plus low cohesion supports decomposing the class into smaller, more focused units to reduce implicit complexity and improve modularization. Other metrics (DIT=3, fanin=0, fanout=0) do not contradict this and the single dependency (PropertyMetaModel) indicates limited coupling that would make extraction feasible."
