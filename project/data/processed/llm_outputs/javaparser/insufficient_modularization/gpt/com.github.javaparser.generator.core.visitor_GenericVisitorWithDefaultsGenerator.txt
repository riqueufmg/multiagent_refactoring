    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=14, nom=2 (nopm=1), wmc=2. Low size and complexity indicate no need for further decomposition. Cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) does not suggest poor cohesion, and fanin=0/fanout=0 show limited coupling. Based on these metrics considered in isolation, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
