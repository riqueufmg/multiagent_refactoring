    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=9, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=1, LCOM=0.0. Low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one dependency indicate limited responsibilities. Despite DIT=3, the minimal size and complexity do not suggest that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
