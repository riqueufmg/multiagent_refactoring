    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: loc=27, nom=8 with most methods public (nopm=7), and LCOM=0.375 indicating good cohesion. Complexity is low (wmc=8) and it has only one field (nof=1). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency). These metrics do not indicate a class that should be further decomposed."
