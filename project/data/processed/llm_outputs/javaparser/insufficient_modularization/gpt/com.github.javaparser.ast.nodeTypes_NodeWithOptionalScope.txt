    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=11, NOM=4, WMC=4. It has no fields (NOF=0) and minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency: com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.Expression). Inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1) and overall size/complexity do not indicate a need for further decomposition. These metrics do not show the large, complex class characteristic of Insufficient Modularization."
