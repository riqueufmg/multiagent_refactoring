    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=9, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=1. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency: PropertyMetaModel). Although DIT=3, there is no evidence of large size or high implementation complexity that would indicate it should be further decomposed."
