    "justification": "Not detected: The class is small-to-moderate in size (loc=144) with a limited number of methods (nom=8, nopm=8) and few fields (nof=2, nopf=0). Complexity is low (wmc=10) and cohesion is high/acceptable (lcom=0.25), indicating related responsibilities are grouped. There are no indications of large fan-out or heavy external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, limited dependencies). Given these metrics, further decomposition is not clearly warranted in isolation."
