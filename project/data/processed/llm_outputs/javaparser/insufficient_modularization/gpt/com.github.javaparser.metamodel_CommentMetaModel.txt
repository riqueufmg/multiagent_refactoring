    "justification": "Metrics indicate a small, low-complexity class: LOC=12, WMC=2, NOM=2, NOF=1. It has minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a single listed dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel). Although LCOM=1.0 suggests low cohesion, the class size and low cyclomatic/structural complexity do not justify further decomposition in isolation. Therefore there is no clear evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
