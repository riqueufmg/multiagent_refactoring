    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.cache.CacheStats",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: it is small (loc=58), has a moderate number of methods (nom=14) with total complexity equal to method count (wmc=14) implying low per-method complexity, exhibits high cohesion (lcom=-1.0), and has no coupling to other elements (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is compact and cohesive, so further decomposition is not clearly warranted when considered in isolation."
