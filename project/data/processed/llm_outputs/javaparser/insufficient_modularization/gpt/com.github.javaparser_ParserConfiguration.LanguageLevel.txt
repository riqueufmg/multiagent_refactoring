    "justification": "The class has moderate size (loc: 129) but contains no methods (nom: 0, nopm: 0) and no implementation complexity (wmc: 0). Its fields (nof: 7, nopf: 4) likely represent data/enum-like values rather than a large behavior that could be decomposed. Cohesion metric is not indicating fragmentation (lcom: -1.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin: 0, fanout: 0, dependencies: [com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.postprocessors.PostProcessors, com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.Validator]). Given the absence of behavioral complexity and low coupling, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
