    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.ConstraintFormula.ReductionResult",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has low behavioral complexity and little internal structure: nom=0, wmc=0, no public methods, only nof=2 fields and loc=77. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on BoundSet). Given the absence of methods and low coupling/complexity, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
