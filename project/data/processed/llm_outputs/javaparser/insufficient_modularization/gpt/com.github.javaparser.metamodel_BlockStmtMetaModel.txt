    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=9, 1 field (nof=1), 1 method (nom=1), low complexity (wmc=1). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0). No fanout or callers (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one dependency. There is no evidence the class is large or handling multiple responsibilities that would warrant further decomposition."
