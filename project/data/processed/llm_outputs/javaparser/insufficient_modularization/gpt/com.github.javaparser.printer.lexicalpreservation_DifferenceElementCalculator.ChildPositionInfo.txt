    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: loc=16, nof=2 fields, nom=0 methods, wmc=0. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only depends on com.github.javaparser.ast.Node. There is no evidence of high size, many responsibilities, or implementation complexity that would indicate it needs further decomposition when considered in isolation."
