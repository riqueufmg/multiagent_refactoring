    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.utils.FileUtils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=11), few methods (NOM=2, NOPM=2), low complexity (WMC=2), high cohesion indicator (LCOM=-1.0), and no coupling/dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). These metrics indicate the class is already simple and adequately decomposed."
