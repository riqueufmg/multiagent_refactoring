    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=4, NOM=0 (no methods), WMC=0 (no complexity), NOF=2 (only two fields), FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, and no dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion metrics are not signalling a need for decomposition here. Given the minimal size and lack of behavior to split, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
