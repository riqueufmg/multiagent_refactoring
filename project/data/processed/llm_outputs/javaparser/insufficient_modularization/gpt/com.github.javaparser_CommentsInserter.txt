    "class": "com.github.javaparser.CommentsInserter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LOC = 124 and WMC = 30 indicate the class is relatively large and contains high overall complexity; NOM = 7 with a high WMC implies several methods are individually complex. Although LCOM = 0.0 suggests methods are cohesive, the high size and complexity metrics (LOC 124, WMC 30) justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce implementation complexity and size."
