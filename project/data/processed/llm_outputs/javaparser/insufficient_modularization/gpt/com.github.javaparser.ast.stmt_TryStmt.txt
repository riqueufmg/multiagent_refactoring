    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.TryStmt",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modularized: high number of methods (nom = 23; nopm = 23) combined with high implementation complexity (wmc = 46) and non-trivial size (loc = 168). Cohesion is moderate (lcom = 0.4347826086956521) rather than high, indicating the class likely spans multiple responsibilities. The presence of many dependencies (NodeList, BlockStmt, visitors, TokenRange, Range, meta models, observable property) together with a deep inheritance depth (dit = 4) and multiple fields (nof = 4) further suggests responsibilities and logic that could be split. These metrics together justify that TryStmt could benefit from further decomposition (extraction of helper/manager subcomponents or smaller classes) to reduce size and complexity."
