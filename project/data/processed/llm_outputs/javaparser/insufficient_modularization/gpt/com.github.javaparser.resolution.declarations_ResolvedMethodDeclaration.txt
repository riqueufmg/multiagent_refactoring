    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=39, NOM=6, NOF=0 and LCOM=-1.0 indicate few methods, no fields, and high cohesion. Complexity is moderate (WMC=11) but not excessive for 6 methods. Low coupling: FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 and only one external dependency. DIT=3 and NC=6 do not by themselves imply the class should be further decomposed. Together these metrics do not support Insufficient Modularization."
