    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=41, NOM=6 (NOPM=3), WMC=9 (moderate), LCOM=0.333 (good cohesion). It has only 2 fields, no incoming/outgoing coupling recorded (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a short inheritance depth (DIT=1). Dependency set is small. Given the limited size, moderate complexity and good cohesion, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization in this class in isolation."
