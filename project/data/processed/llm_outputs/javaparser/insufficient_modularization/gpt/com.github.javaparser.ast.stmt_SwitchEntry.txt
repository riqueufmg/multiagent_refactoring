    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.SwitchEntry",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being too large/complex for a single unit: 24 methods (nom = 24), 193 lines of code (loc = 193) and a high weighted methods complexity (wmc = 46). There are 24 publicly visible methods (nopm = 24), which suggests many exposed behaviors. Although cohesion is relatively good (lcom = 0.25), the combination of high method count, substantial LOC and elevated WMC indicates substantial implementation complexity that could be reduced by further decomposition. The inheritance depth (dit = 3) adds additional complexity to the class's behavior. These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
