    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it defines a large number of methods (nom = 17) within a relatively small source (loc = 93) while exhibiting high overall complexity (wmc = 25). Cohesion is only moderate (lcom = 0.588), suggesting the methods are not tightly focused on a single responsibility. There is only one field (nof = 1) but many methods (nopm = 17), which often indicates behavior that could be split into smaller, more cohesive units. The depth of inheritance (dit = 4) further implies accumulated responsibilities. Taken in isolation, these metrics support that the class could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity and improve cohesion."
