    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has high method count and public surface (nom=26, nopm=22) and substantial implementation size (loc=197) with high complexity (wmc=51), which indicate a large, multifaceted implementation. The class depends on many distinct AST node types (CompilationUnit, EnumDeclaration, SwitchStmt, FieldDeclaration, TypeDeclaration, Node, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, ReturnStmt, VariableDeclarator, MethodDeclaration, ConstructorDeclaration), suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities or navigation concerns. These factors (many methods, many public methods, high WMC/LOC, and wide variety of dependent types) justify that the class is insufficiently modular and could be decomposed into smaller, more focused components."
