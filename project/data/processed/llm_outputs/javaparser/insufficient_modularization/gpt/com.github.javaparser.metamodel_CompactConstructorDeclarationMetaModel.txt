    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.CompactConstructorDeclarationMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple (loc=13), has low implementation complexity (wmc=1), only one method (nom=1), and high cohesion (lcom=0.0). It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a small number of fields (nof=5). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and does not show signs that it needs further decomposition."
