    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.comments.BlockComment",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=49, NOM=13 with WMC=13 (average complexity per method low), LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion, and NOF=0 (no fields). There is no coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although DIT=4 shows inheritance depth, there is no evidence the class is overly large or complex and therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
