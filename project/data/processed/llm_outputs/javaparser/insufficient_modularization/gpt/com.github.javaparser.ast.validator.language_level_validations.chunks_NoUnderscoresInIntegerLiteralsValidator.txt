    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=15, WMC=4, nom=3 methods, no fields (nof=0). Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) with only a few dependencies. Given the low size and complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity — it appears sufficiently modular."
