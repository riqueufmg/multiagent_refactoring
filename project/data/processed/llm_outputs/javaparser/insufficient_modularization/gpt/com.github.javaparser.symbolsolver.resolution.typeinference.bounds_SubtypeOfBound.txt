    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.bounds.SubtypeOfBound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=60, NOM=11 (average ~5.5 LOC/method), WMC=17 (moderate complexity), LCOM=0.1818 (high cohesion). It has only 2 fields, DIT=1, and zero measured coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependency set is small (3 types). These metrics indicate the class is reasonably sized, focused and not overly complex, so there is no evidence it requires further decomposition."
