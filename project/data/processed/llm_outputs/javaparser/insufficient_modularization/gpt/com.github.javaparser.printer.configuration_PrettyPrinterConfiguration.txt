    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration.PrettyPrinterConfiguration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exposes a large surface and implementation size: 34 methods (nom = 34), 170 lines of code (loc = 170) and a weighted methods complexity of 34 (wmc = 34). These values indicate significant behavioral content concentrated in a single class. Although there is only 1 field (nof = 1) and a low LCOM (0.0) suggesting cohesion among methods, the high method count and complexity suggest the class has multiple responsibilities or sizable behavior that could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity. Other metrics: dit = 1, fanin = 0, fanout = 0; the primary drivers for detection are nom, loc and wmc."
