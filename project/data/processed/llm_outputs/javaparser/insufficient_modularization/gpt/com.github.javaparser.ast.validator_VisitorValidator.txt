    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.VisitorValidator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=8, nom=1, nopm=1, WMC=1. It has low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shows high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). There is only a single method to consider and minimal dependencies (ProblemReporter, Node). These characteristics indicate the class is already highly modular and does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
