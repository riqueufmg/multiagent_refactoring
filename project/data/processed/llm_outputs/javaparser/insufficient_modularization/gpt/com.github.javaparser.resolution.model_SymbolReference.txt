    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=71), moderate complexity (wmc=11), modest method count (nom=9, nopm=8), and high cohesion (lcom=0.222). Additionally, no external coupling is reported (fanin=0, fanout=0). These factors suggest the class is reasonably decomposed and does not require further modularization."
