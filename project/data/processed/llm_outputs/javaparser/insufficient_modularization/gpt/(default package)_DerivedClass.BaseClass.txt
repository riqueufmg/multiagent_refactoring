    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc = 2), no methods (nom = 0), no fields (nof = 0), no complex logic (wmc = 0), cohesion indicator LCOM = -1.0 (suggesting high cohesion for the trivial class), and no coupling or dependencies (fanin = 0, fanout = 0, dependencies = []). Given these metrics the class is trivial and does not require further decomposition."
