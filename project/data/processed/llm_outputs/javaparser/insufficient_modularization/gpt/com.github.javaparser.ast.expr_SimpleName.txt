    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit characteristics of an undecomposed, monolithic class: small size (loc=48), very few fields (nof=1), a modest number of methods (nom=10) and moderate complexity (wmc=11). Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although cohesion is only moderate (lcom=0.6) and inheritance depth is non-zero (dit=3), these do not by themselves indicate that the class should be further decomposed. Overall the metrics point to a small, focused class rather than one suffering from insufficient modularization."
