    "justification": "Not detected: the class is minimal and shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized. Metrics: LOC=2, NOF=0, NOPF=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0, WMC=0, NC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no fields, no methods, no complexity, and no dependencies, so there is no internal size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
