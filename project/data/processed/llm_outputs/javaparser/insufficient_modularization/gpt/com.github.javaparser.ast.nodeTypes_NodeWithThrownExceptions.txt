    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.nodeTypes.NodeWithThrownExceptions",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=45 (small size), WMC=8 (low-to-moderate complexity), NOM=8 (moderate number of methods) and LCOM=-1.0 (indicates high cohesion). It has no fields (NOF=0, NOPF=0) and zero coupling signals (fanin=0, fanout=0). Dependencies are limited and focused (NodeList, ReferenceType, StaticJavaParser). Given the low size, low complexity, high cohesion and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that this class is insufficiently modularized or requires further decomposition."
