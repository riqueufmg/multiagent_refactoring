    "justification": "Metrics indicate a very small, simple, and cohesive class that does not need further decomposition: LOC=8, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=0, NOPF=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, dependencies=[]. LCOM=-1.0 does not suggest low cohesion given the single method and no fields. The low size and complexity (few methods, no fields, no coupling) justify not flagging Insufficient Modularization."
