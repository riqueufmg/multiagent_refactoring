    "justification": "The class is very small and cohesive: loc=9, nom=1, nof=1, nopf=1, nopm=0, wmc=1 (very low complexity), lcom=0.0 (high cohesion). Fanin=0 and fanout=0 and only one listed dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel). Given the minimal size, single method/field, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
