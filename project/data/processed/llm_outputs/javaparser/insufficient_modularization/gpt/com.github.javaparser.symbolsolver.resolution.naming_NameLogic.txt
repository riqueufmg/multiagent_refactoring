    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.naming.NameLogic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 599), very high implementation complexity (wmc = 184), and a relatively large number of methods (nom = 22) with a non-trivial public surface (nopm = 7). The average complexity per method is high (~8.4), indicating multiple responsibilities packed into methods. The class depends on many distinct concepts (AST nodes, NameCategory, NameRole, TypeSolver, Context, SymbolReference, ResolvedType/ReferenceTypeDeclaration, JavaParserFactory), suggesting it mixes concerns across parsing, naming, and resolution. These metrics and diverse dependencies together justify that the class should be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
