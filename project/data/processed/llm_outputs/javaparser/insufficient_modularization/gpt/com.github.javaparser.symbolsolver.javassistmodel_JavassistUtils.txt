    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javassistmodel.JavassistUtils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Size and complexity indicators show the class is a candidate for further decomposition: LOC = 156 and WMC = 39 (high complexity), with NOM = 12 (many methods). The class depends on a wide range of concerns (as seen in dependencies: JavassistClassDeclaration, JavassistMethodDeclaration, JavassistInterfaceDeclaration, ResolvedType/ResolvedWildcard/ResolvedPrimitiveType/ResolvedVoidType, ResolvedMethodDeclaration, MethodResolutionLogic, TypeSolver, ContextHelper, MethodUsage, ResolvedTypeParametrizable, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, SymbolReference, Context) which suggests it handles multiple responsibilities (class/type handling, method resolution, type parameter logic, context/type solver interactions). Although LCOM = -1.0 does not indicate low cohesion, the combination of high LOC and high WMC plus interaction with many distinct concepts implies the implementation complexity could be reduced by splitting JavassistUtils into smaller, focused utility components (for example: type utilities, method-resolution utilities, and context/solver helpers). Therefore Insufficient Modularization is detected."
