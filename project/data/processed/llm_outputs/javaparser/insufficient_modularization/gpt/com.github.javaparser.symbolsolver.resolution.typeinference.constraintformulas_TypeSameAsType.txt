    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: loc=60, nom=5, nof=2. Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0) and inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1). Although WMC=17 shows some internal complexity, it is distributed across only 5 methods (nom=5) and does not, by itself, justify further decomposition. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, indicating no broad coupling that would suggest splitting responsibilities. Overall size, cohesion, and coupling metrics do not support the Insufficient Modularization smell."
