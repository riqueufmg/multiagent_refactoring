    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=8 (very small), NOM=6 with WMC=6 (methods are low-complexity overall), LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion). It has no fields (nof=0) and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is compact and well-focused, so there is no evidence that it should be further decomposed."
