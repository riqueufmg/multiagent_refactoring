    "justification": "Class is not a candidate for Insufficient Modularization: very small and simple implementation (LOC=5), only one method (NOM=1), low complexity (WMC=1), no fields (NOF=0), no inheritance depth (DIT=0), high cohesion indicator (LCOM=-1.0), and no inter-class coupling (Fanin=0, Fanout=0). These elements indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
