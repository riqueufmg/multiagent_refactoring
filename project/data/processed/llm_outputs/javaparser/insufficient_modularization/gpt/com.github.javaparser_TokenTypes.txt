    "justification": "High weighted methods complexity (wmc=166) for a small class (loc=66) with only 10 methods (nom=10, nopm=10) indicates very high average complexity per method (~16.6). The class has no fields (nof=0) and minimal external dependencies (2) yet concentrates heavy implementation complexity internally, which matches Insufficient Modularization: the class appears not fully decomposed and would benefit from further decomposition to reduce size/complexity."
