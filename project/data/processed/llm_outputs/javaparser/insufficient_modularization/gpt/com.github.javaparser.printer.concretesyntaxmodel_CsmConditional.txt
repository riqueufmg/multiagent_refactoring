    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that needs further decomposition: LOC = 78 and WMC = 13 show modest size and complexity; NOM = 9 and NOF = 4 are small; NOPF = 0 (no public fields) reduces encapsulation concerns. LCOM = 0.0 indicates high cohesion among members. DIT = 1 and fanin = 0 / fanout = 0 show limited inheritance depth and coupling. Dependencies are few and focused (SourcePrinter, CsmElement, Node, ObservableProperty, inner Condition). Taken in isolation, these elements suggest the class is cohesive and not large or complex enough to justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
