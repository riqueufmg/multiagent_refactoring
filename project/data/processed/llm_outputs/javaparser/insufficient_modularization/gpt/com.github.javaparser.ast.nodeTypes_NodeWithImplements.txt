    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization: loc=49 (small), nom=10 and wmc=10 (moderate complexity distributed across methods), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (low coupling), dependencies are limited to 3 types. dit=0 (no deep inheritance). lcom=-1.0 is not a usable indicator here. Given the small LOC, limited dependencies, and moderate per-class complexity, there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further."
