    "class": "com.github.javaparser.JavaParser",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large and exposes many responsibilities in isolation: 37 methods (36 public), 366 lines of code and a WMC of 42 indicating nontrivial implementation complexity. Its LCOM is 0.8108108108108109, which indicates low cohesion between methods. The dependency list shows it touches many distinct concerns and AST node types (AnnotationExpr, ImportDeclaration, Expression, Statement, Node, LineComment, CommentsInserter, CommentsCollection, BodyDeclaration, Providers/Provider, ParseResult/ParseStart/ParseException, CompilationUnit, BlockStmt, ParserConfiguration, Comment, GeneratedJavaParser), suggesting multiple responsibilities are handled in this single class. The combination of high method count, high complexity, low cohesion, many public methods, and broad dependency surface supports that the class has insufficient modularization and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
