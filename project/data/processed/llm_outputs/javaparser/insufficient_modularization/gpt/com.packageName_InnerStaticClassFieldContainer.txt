    "justification": "Class is small and lacks internal complexity: LOC=13, NOF=1, NOM=0, WMC=0, NC=0, DIT=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. With a single field, no methods, and no dependencies, there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed; further modularization is not warranted based on the provided metrics."
