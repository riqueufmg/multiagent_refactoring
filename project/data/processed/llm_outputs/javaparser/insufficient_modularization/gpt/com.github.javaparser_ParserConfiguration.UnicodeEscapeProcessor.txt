    "justification": "Class is small and already minimal: loc=21, nof=1 (one field), nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no complexity). Coupling is negligible (fanin=0, fanout=0) and depth of inheritance is shallow (dit=1). These metrics indicate no significant size or implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
