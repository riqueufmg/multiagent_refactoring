    "justification": "Class is small and already minimal: LOC=9, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0. There are no fields (NOF=0), no incoming or outgoing dependencies (FANIN=0, FANOUT=0), and only a single method, so there is no evidence this class has not been decomposed further. The high DIT (20) is noted but, considered in isolation, does not imply internal complexity or a need for additional modularization."
