    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=15, NOM=3, WMC=4. LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. There is no evidence of large size or high implementation complexity that would motivate further decomposition. Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 show it is self-contained with no broad coupling. Given these metrics and considering the class in isolation, there is no indication of Insufficient Modularization."
