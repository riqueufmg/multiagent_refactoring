    "class": "(default package).X",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class X shows no signs of insufficient modularization: LOC=5 (very small), NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, NC=0, DIT=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 and no dependencies. There are no methods or fields to decompose and complexity/size metrics are minimal, so there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
