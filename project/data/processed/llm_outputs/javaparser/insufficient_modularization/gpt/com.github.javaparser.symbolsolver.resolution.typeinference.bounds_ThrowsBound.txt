    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=33, NOM=7, WMC=9 (moderate), LCOM=0.2857 (good cohesion). It has a single field (NOF=1), no package-level fields (NOPF=0), shallow inheritance (DIT=1) and no incoming/outgoing coupling recorded (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not indicate an incompletely decomposed or overly large/complex class, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
