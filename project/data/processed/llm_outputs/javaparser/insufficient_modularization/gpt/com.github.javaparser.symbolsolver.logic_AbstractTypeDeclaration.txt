    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed class: small size (LOC = 54) and few methods (nom = 3, nopm = 3) mean the class surface is limited; cyclomatic/implementation complexity is moderate (WMC = 8) but not unusually high for a candidate for decomposition; cohesion is high (LCOM = -1.0) which argues against splitting; low coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0 and only one listed dependency: com.github.javaparser.resolution.MethodUsage) shows limited external responsibilities. DIT = 4 indicates inheritance depth but, in isolation, does not by itself imply insufficient modularization. Therefore there is no strong evidence of the Insufficient Modularization smell."
