    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body.TypeDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows indicators of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 172), many methods (nom = 24, nopm = 24) and high complexity (wmc = 42) suggesting multiple responsibilities or heavy implementation. Cohesion is moderate (lcom = 0.4583333333333333) rather than high, which supports that functionality could be split. The class has non-trivial inheritance depth (dit = 4) and depends on a variety of other types (13 distinct dependencies) implying it handles several concerns. Additionally, there are no public fields (nopf = 0) while behaviour is concentrated in many methods, another sign that responsibilities might be bundled in this single class. These combined metrics justify refactoring into smaller, more focused classes or extracting responsibilities to reduce size and complexity."
