    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=11, NOM=2, WMC=2. Cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0). No incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no listed dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already compact and cohesive, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
