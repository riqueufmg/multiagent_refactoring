    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ParserConfiguration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc=339) combined with high implementation complexity (wmc=41) and many members (nom=28 methods, nof=21 fields, nopm=28 public methods). It also depends on a wide range of concerns (UnicodeEscapeProcessingProvider, LineEndingProcessingProvider, PostProcessors/Validator, SymbolResolver, Node, Providers, ParseResult, LanguageLevel), indicating multiple responsibilities being handled in one place. Although cohesion is not extremely low (lcom=0.25), the absolute volume of code and complexity suggest the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity and separate distinct configuration concerns."
