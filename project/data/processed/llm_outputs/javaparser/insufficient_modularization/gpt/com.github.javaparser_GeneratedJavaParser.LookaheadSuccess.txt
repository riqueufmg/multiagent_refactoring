    "justification": "Class is extremely small and contains no decomposable elements: LOC=2, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPM=0, WMC=0, NC=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, LCOM=-1.0. With no methods or fields and negligible complexity, there is nothing to further decompose in isolation, so Insufficient Modularization is not present."
