    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High size and complexity: loc=788, wmc=189, nom=46, nof=12. Very few public entry points with many internal operations: nopm=1, nopf=1 (many methods/fields are internal). Presence of multiple nested types (Difference.EnforcingIndentationContext, Difference.ArrayIterator) and large set of dependencies across different concerns (ReshuffledDiffElementExtractor, LexicalDifferenceCalculator, LexicalPreservingPrinter, CsmElement, TokenTextElement, NodeText, Added/Removed/Kept/RemovedGroup, JavaToken, TokenTypes, Comment, Node, GeneratedJavaParserConstants) indicate the class handles many responsibilities. Although LCOM=0.065 suggests cohesion, the combination of large LOC, high cyclomatic complexity, many methods, and embedded helper types shows the class has not been decomposed into smaller collaborating classes — consistent with Insufficient Modularization."
