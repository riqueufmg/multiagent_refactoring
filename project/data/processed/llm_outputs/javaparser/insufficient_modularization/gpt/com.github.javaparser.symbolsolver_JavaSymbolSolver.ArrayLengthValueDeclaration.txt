    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=11, number of fields (nof)=1, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted methods per class (wmc)=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion metrics are not applicable due to lack of methods. These metrics show very small size, no implementation complexity, and low coupling, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
