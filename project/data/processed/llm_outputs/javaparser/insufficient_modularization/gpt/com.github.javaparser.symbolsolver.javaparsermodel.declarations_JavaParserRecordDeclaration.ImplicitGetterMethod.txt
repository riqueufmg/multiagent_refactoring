    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: LOC is small (55), number of fields is low (nof=3) and there are no methods reported (nom=0), complexity is negligible (wmc=0), and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, only 4 external type dependencies). Although DIT=4 shows inheritance depth, there is no indication of high size or implementation complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
