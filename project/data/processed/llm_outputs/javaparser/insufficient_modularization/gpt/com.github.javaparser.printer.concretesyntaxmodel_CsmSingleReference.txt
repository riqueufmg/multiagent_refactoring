    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=18, NOM=4, WMC=5, LCOM=0.0. It has no public fields (NOPF=0) and no incoming/outgoing coupling recorded (fanin=0, fanout=0). Depth of inheritance is shallow (DIT=1). Given the low size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or that it should be further decomposed."
