    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.type.TypeParameter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of Insufficient Modularization: it defines a large number of methods (nom=24, nopm=24) and moderate size (loc=136) while maintaining only 2 fields (nof=2), indicating behavior is spread across many operations rather than localized state. Complexity is relatively high (wmc=35) and cohesion is low (lcom=0.5416666666666666), which suggests multiple responsibilities or unrelated functionality within the same class. The inheritance depth (dit=5) and numerous external dependencies (multiple types referenced such as ResolvedTypeVariable, JavaParserMetaModel, GenericVisitor, SimpleName, NodeList, ResolvedType, Node, etc.) further imply the class coordinates varied concerns. Taken together — many methods, elevated complexity, low cohesion, and broad dependencies despite little internal state — this class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
