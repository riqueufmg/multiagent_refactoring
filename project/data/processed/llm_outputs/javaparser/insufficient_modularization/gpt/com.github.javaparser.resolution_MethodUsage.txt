    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 24 methods (23 public), 175 LOC and a WMC of 38, indicating a relatively large public surface and moderate implementation complexity. The high number of public methods (nopm=23) suggests multiple responsibilities or API surface that could be split. The class also depends on several distinct resolution types (ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, ResolvedTypeParametersMap, ResolvedMethodDeclaration, ResolvedType), which implies it handles multiple concerns. Although LCOM=0 indicates internal cohesion, the combination of many public methods, size (LOC=175) and complexity (WMC=38) supports that further decomposition could reduce size and simplify the implementation."
