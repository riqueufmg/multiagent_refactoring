    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.reflectionmodel.ReflectionFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected because complexity and multiple responsibilities are concentrated in a small number of methods. Metrics: LOC=96 and WMC=27 indicate a relatively large and highly complex implementation; NOM=3 (NOPM=2) shows that complexity is concentrated into very few methods; LCOM=0.666 signals moderate-to-low cohesion (methods likely operate on different concerns). Dependency list (ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, ResolvedWildcard, ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration, ReflectionTypeParameter, TypeSolver, AbstractTypeDeclaration, AccessSpecifier, ResolvedReferenceType, ResolvedType, ResolvedPrimitiveType, ResolvedVoidType) shows the class handles many distinct type-related concerns, implying multiple responsibilities. Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 indicate the class is isolated rather than delegating to collaborators. Together these factors justify that the class is insufficiently modular and should be decomposed into smaller, more focused components."
