    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.concretesyntaxmodel.CsmList",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "WMC=23 (high cyclomatic complexity), NOM=10 and NOPM=10 (many methods/public methods), LOC=82 (non-trivial size) and NOF=5 (multiple fields) indicate a relatively large and complex class. DIT=1 shows little decomposition via inheritance. Although LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion, the combination of high complexity and method count suggests the class may be shouldering multiple responsibilities that could be split to reduce WMC and LOC. The class also depends on several distinct types (PrintingHelper, SourcePrinter, NodeList, CsmElement, Node, ObservableProperty, ConcreteSyntaxModel), which is consistent with mixed responsibilities. Considering the class in isolation, these elements justify that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
