    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and low-complexity: loc=11, nom=2, wmc=2, nopm=1, nof=0 (no fields). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies limited), inheritance depth is minimal (dit=1) and cohesion metric is not indicative of poor cohesion (lcom=-1.0). Given the tiny size and low complexity, there is no evidence this class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
