    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.GenericVisitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: it declares a very large number of methods (nom = 103) and a correspondingly high complexity metric (wmc = 103) while only 109 lines of code (loc = 109), indicating the class is responsible for many small, distinct operations. The dependency list shows the class directly references a wide range of AST node types (examples: MethodDeclaration, IfStmt, ForStmt, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, EnumDeclaration, SwitchStmt, TryStmt, LambdaExpr, AnnotationDeclaration, CompilationUnit, ArrayType, PrimitiveType, RecordDeclaration, Module* directives, many statement and expression node types), which implies it handles many different responsibilities. Taken in isolation, these metrics and the extensive, varied dependencies justify that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from splitting into smaller, more focused modules/visitors to reduce size and implementation complexity."
