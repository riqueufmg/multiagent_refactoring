    "justification": "High size and complexity with low cohesion indicate insufficient modularization: LOC=120, WMC=24 (avg complexity ~4 per method given NOM=6), NOM=6 with NOPM=4, NOF=5 (NOPF=3). LCOM=0.666 suggests low cohesion (multiple responsibilities). Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 do not mitigate the internal complexity. These metrics collectively justify decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
