    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=30, number of methods=1, WMC=1. It has low coupling (fanout=0, fanin=0, single dependency listed) and high cohesion (LCOM=0). It has only 2 fields and no public fields indicated. Although DIT=10 is high, in isolation the class size and low complexity do not indicate it has not been decomposed further; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
