    "justification": "The class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: loc=36, nom=6, wmc=9 (moderate complexity), nof=0 (no fields to split), nopf=0, nopm=6, fanin=0, fanout=0. The negative LCOM value indicates high cohesion. Given the low LOC, limited number of methods, absence of fields, and no high coupling, there is insufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
