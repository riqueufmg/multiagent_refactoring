    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: loc=11, nom=0 (no methods), wmc=0 (no complexity), nof=2 (only two fields), fanin=0, fanout=0, and no dependencies. In isolation these metrics indicate a tiny holder/marker-like class rather than a large undecomposed class, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
