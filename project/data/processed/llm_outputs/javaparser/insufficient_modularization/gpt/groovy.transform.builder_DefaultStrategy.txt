    "class": "groovy.transform.builder.DefaultStrategy",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Insufficient modularization detected: the class has a high number of methods (nom = 15) and a high cyclomatic/weighted-methods complexity (wmc = 26) for its size (loc = 117). Cohesion is very low (lcom = 0.9333333333333332), indicating multiple, poorly related responsibilities. There are only 2 fields (nof = 2) but many methods (many likely private helpers) and only 3 public methods (nopm = 3), which suggests the class contains multiple internal responsibilities that could be split into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
