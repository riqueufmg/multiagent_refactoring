    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=12, WMC=1 (low complexity), NOM=1 (single method), LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion), FANOUT=0 and FANIN=0 (low coupling). Although NOF=4, the overall size and complexity do not indicate an undecomposed class; further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity."
