    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=16, NOM=3, NOF=1, LCOM=0.0. Complexity is low (WMC=4) and inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=1). Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on com.github.javaparser.ast.NodeList). Given the small size, low complexity, high cohesion, and low coupling when considered in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
