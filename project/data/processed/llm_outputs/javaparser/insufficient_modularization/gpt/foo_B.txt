    "class": "foo.B",

    "justification": "Class has extremely small size and no internal structure to decompose: LOC=2, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=0 (no fields), WMC=0, NC=0. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 indicate no coupling to split across modules. DIT=1 and LCOM=-1.0 do not indicate internal complexity. Therefore this class is not a candidate for further decomposition (Insufficient Modularization = false)."
