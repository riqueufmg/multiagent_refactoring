    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=9, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. These metrics indicate low size and low implementation complexity (single method, no fields, no coupling). Although DIT=15 is high, in isolation it does not imply this class contains multiple responsibilities that require decomposition. LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion is not a problem. Therefore there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
