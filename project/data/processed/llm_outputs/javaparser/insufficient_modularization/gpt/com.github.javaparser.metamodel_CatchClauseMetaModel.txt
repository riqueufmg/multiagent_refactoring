    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.CatchClauseMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=10, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=2. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, single listed dependency: com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel). Depth of inheritance is modest (DIT=2). Given the low size, low complexity, high cohesion and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
