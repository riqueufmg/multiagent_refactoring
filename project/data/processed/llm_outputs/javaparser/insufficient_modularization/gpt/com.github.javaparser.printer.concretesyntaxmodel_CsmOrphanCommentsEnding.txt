    "justification": "Class is small and focused: LOC=23, NOM=1 (NOPM=1), NOF=0. It has no fields and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Cyclomatic/weight metric WMC=5 is modest for a single-method class. Given the single responsibility (one method) and low size/complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or implementation complexity."
