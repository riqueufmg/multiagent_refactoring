    "class": "com.github.javaparser.javasymbolsolver.javassist_symbols.main_jar.InterfaceUserExcludedJar",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: LOC=3, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, and there are no dependencies. With no methods, negligible complexity, and minimal size, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
