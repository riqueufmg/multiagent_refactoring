    "class": "implements_duplicate.A",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and contains no members or behavior: loc=4, nom=0, nof=0, nopm=0, wmc=0. It has no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no methods to decompose, so there is no evidence that it is insufficiently modularized. The unusually high DIT (3096) and LCOM (-1.0) are inconsistent with the empty class content and, in isolation, do not indicate a need for further decomposition."
