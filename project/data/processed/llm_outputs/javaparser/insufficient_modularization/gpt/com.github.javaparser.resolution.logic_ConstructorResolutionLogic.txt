    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic.ConstructorResolutionLogic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high size and complexity (loc=145, wmc=36) concentrated in a small number of methods (nom=6, nopm=3) which implies individual methods are large/complex and could be further decomposed. The class depends on multiple distinct concepts (ResolvedConstructorDeclaration, MethodResolutionLogic, ResolvedType, TypeSolver, SymbolReference), suggesting it handles multiple aspects of resolution logic that could be separated. Together these metrics indicate that further decomposition (splitting complex methods or extracting helper/responsibility-specific classes) would likely reduce implementation complexity and size."
