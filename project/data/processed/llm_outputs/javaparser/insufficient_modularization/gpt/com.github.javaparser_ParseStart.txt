    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ParseStart",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a very high number of fields (nof=22) but only a single method (nom=1) and very low implementation complexity (wmc=1, loc=29). This combination indicates the class principally aggregates a large amount of state with minimal behavior, which is a hallmark of insufficient decomposition. Low coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) imply splitting it into smaller, cohesive classes is feasible. Therefore further modularization/decomposition is warranted."
