    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=24, NOM=3, WMC=4 indicate low size and low complexity. Cohesion appears high (LCOM=-1.0) and there are no fields (NOF=0), suggesting focused responsibility. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although DIT=4, given the low method count and low complexity, there is no indication the class is insufficiently modularized and would benefit from further decomposition."
