    "justification": "Class is small and reasonably cohesive: LOC=51, NOM=9, WMC=15 indicate modest size and complexity; LCOM=0.333 shows acceptable cohesion. It has very few fields (NOF=1, NOPF=0) and no measured coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). DIT=2 is shallow. Given these metrics, there is no strong evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
