    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.PackageDeclaration",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has characteristics of insufficient modularization: relatively high method count (nom = 14) and implementation complexity (WMC = 25) for a modest size (LOC = 109), while exposing only 2 fields (nof = 2). Cohesion is moderate/low (LCOM = 0.4286), suggesting methods do not all work on the same small set of fields. The class also depends on many external types (multiple entries in the dependency list) and has a non-trivial inheritance depth (DIT = 3). These elements together indicate multiple responsibilities and complexity that could be reduced by decomposing the class into smaller, more focused modules."
