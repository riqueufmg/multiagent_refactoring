    "justification": "Metrics indicate a very small/trivial class: LOC=14, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, and no dependencies. There are no methods or fields to decompose and no complexity or coupling that would justify further modularization. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected for this class."
