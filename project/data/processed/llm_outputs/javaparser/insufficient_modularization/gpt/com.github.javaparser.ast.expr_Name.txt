    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a large public surface and considerable complexity: number of methods nom=19 with nopm=19 (all methods public) and WMC=29, and size LOC=115. It holds very little state (nof=2, nopf=0) but implements many behaviors, which is a sign it is doing multiple responsibilities. Cohesion is only moderate (LCOM=0.3684) and DIT=3 indicates inheritance depth adding to complexity. Together these metrics suggest the class is insufficiently modular and could be decomposed to reduce size, implementation complexity, and public API surface."
