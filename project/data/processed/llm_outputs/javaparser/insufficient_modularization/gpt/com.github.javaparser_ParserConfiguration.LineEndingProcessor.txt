    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and not complex: LOC=19, WMC=0, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=1 (single field). Low coupling and usage: FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, only 2 declared dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 (no method cohesion concerns because there are no methods). Given the minimal size, zero implementation complexity, and lack of methods or internal responsibilities, there is no evidence this class suffers from insufficient modularization."
