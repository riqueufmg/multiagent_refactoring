    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=9, NOM=1, NOPM=1, WMC=1. It has no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and LCOM=-1.0 indicates no field-based cohesion concerns. Given the single method, low complexity and lack of dependencies, there is no evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized; further decomposition is not warranted based on the provided metrics."
