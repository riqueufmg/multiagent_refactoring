    "justification": "The class is minimal and contains no decomposable implementation: loc=2, nof=0, nom=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, nc=0. It has no incoming or outgoing usages (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 indicates no meaningful cohesion measurement (no methods/fields). Given the absence of size, methods, or complexity, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
