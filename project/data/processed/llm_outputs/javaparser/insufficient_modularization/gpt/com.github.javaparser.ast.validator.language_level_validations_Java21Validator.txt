    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and low-complexity: LOC=12, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0, NOPM=1. It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a cohesion metric LCOM=-1.0. Given the minimal size and complexity of the class in isolation, there is no evidence it has not been sufficiently decomposed; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected. (DIT=24 is noted but does not, by itself, indicate internal overlarge class size.)"
