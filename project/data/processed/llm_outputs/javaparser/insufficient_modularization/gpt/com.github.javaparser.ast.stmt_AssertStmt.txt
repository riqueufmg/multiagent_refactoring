    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a relatively high number of methods (nom = 19) and non-trivial size (loc = 113) while exhibiting elevated complexity (wmc = 30). Cohesion is moderate to low (lcom ≈ 0.526), suggesting the methods are not tightly focused on a single responsibility. Additionally, there are only 2 fields (nof = 2) but many methods operating with limited shared state, which often indicates multiple responsibilities packed into one class rather than cohesive behavior. The combination of high method/complexity metrics and reduced cohesion justifies that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
