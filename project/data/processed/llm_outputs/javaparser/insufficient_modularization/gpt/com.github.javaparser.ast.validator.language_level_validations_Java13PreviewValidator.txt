    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=15, nom=1, nopm=1 and wmc=1 indicate a single, low-complexity method. Cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0). No incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies are listed. Although DIT=17 is high, the class itself has minimal size and complexity and therefore does not show signs of insufficient modularization."
