    "justification": "The class is trivial and does not show signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=3), a single field (nof=1) and no methods (nom=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), no subclasses (dit=0). These metrics indicate there is no substantial implementation to decompose further."
