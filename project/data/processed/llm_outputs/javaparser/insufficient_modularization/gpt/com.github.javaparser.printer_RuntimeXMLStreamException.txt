    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=11, NOM=2, WMC=2. It has no fields (NOF=0) and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion is not a problem. These metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
