    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected based on indicators of concentrated size and mixed responsibilities: high number of methods (nom = 17) and relatively high weighted methods complexity (wmc = 25) for a single class, moderate source size (loc = 95), and low cohesion (lcom = 0.588) which suggests the methods do not form a highly cohesive unit. The class has only one field (nof = 1) while exposing many methods, a typical sign that behavior could be split into focused components. The dependency list (visitor interfaces, metamodel, Range/TokenRange, Node, ObservableProperty, SimpleName) shows multiple conceptual concerns present (visitor handling, metadata, position/token management, observer support, name/identifier handling). These metrics and dependencies together indicate the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce per-class complexity and improve cohesion."
