    "justification": "Class is small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=38, NOM=3, NOF=0, NOPF=0, NOPM=0 indicate few members; WMC=10 shows moderate method complexity but not excessive; DIT=0 and FANIN=0/FANOUT=0 imply no deep hierarchy or coupling that would suggest splitting; LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion. Dependencies are limited to three types. Overall metrics show manageable size and cohesion, so no insufficient modularization detected."
