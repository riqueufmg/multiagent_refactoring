    "justification": "The class is minimal in isolation: LOC=1, no fields (nof=0), no methods (nom=0), WMC=0, no inheritance depth (dit=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate there is no size or implementation complexity that would benefit from further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
