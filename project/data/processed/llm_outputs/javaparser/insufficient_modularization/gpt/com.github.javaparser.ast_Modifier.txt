    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Multiple indicators of insufficient modularization: a high number of methods (nom = 24, nopm = 24 — all methods public) together with a small number of fields (nof = 2) and modest size (loc = 106) suggests many independent behaviours concentrated in one class; high complexity (wmc = 25) indicates non-trivial method logic overall; low cohesion (lcom = 0.875) signals that methods are not tightly related to the same state, implying multiple responsibilities; the class references many different concerns in its dependencies (visitor types, AccessSpecifier, TokenRange, ObservableProperty, meta-model classes), reinforcing that it handles diverse roles. These facts justify flagging Insufficient Modularization and recommend splitting responsibilities into smaller classes/components."
