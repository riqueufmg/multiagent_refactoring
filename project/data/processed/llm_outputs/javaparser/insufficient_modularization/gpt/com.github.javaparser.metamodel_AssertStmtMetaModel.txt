    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=10, nom=1, wmc=1, nof=2. Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0). Low complexity and size indicate it has been sufficiently decomposed; fanin=0 and fanout=0 show no coupling pressure. Although DIT=3, the class itself is minimal and does not exhibit the size or complexity typical of Insufficient Modularization."
