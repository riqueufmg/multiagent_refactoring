    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: loc=10, wmc=1, nom=1, nof=2. It shows high cohesion (lcom=0.0), no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel). Although DIT=4 indicates inheritance depth, the very low size and complexity metrics indicate there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed — no need for further modularization."
