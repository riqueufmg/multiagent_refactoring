    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small (loc=64) despite having 15 methods (nom=15), indicating many short/simple methods rather than a large monolithic implementation. Cyclomatic weight (wmc=16) is moderate and does not by itself show excessive complexity that would require decomposition. Cohesion metric is lcom=-1.0 (no clear sign of low cohesion in the provided data), and coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0) show no strong cross-class coupling that would suggest mixed responsibilities. Depth of inheritance (dit=4) reflects inheritance but not necessarily insufficient modularization in isolation. Overall metrics do not justify refactoring into additional classes given only the provided class-level data."
