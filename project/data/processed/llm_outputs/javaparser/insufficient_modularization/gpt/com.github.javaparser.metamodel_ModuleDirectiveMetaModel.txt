    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=11, NOM=2, WMC=2 indicate low size and low complexity. LCOM=-1.0 signals high cohesion. It has no fields (NOF=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no dependencies listed. Given these metrics, there is no evidence the class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
