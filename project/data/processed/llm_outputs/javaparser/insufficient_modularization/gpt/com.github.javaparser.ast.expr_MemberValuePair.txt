    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.MemberValuePair",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has very few fields (nof=2) but a relatively large public API (nom=13, nopm=13) and high implementation complexity (wmc=20) for a small size (loc=80). The low field-to-method ratio (2 fields vs 13 methods) and moderate cohesion (lcom=0.4615) indicate multiple responsibilities that could be split into smaller classes. Additionally, the class depends on many varied concerns (visitor interfaces, meta-model types, token/range/observer utilities) which suggests mixed responsibilities that would benefit from decomposition."
