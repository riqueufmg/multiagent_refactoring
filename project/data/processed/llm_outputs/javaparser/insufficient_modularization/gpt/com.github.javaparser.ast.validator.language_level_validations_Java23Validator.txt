    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and focused: loc=8, nom=1, wmc=1, nof=0/nopf=0 (no fields), lcom=-1.0 (high cohesion). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and complexity and no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity. (DIT=26 is high but the class itself contains minimal behavior, so it does not by itself indicate insufficient modularization.)"
