    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.Visitable",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected. The class is very small and simple (LOC=18, NOM=2), has low complexity (WMC=2), shows high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0), has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0). Given these metrics the class does not exhibit the size or complexity that would indicate it should be further decomposed."
