    "justification": "Not detected: class size and complexity are modest (loc=62, wmc=13) and method count is moderate (nom=12, nopm=11) with only one field (nof=1, nopf=1). Cohesion is good (lcom=0.333), and there is no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is reasonably cohesive and not large/complex enough to require further decomposition."
