    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.contexts.AnonymousClassDeclarationContext",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high implementation complexity relative to its size and interface: WMC = 20 with only NOM = 4 (average complexity ≈ 5 per method) and LOC = 78, which indicates large/complex methods that could be split. Cohesion is moderate (LCOM = 0.5) rather than high, suggesting multiple responsibilities or weakly related functionality inside the class. There is only one field (NOF = 1) while the class depends on many external types (10 listed dependencies), implying it manages varied concerns itself. Taken together (high WMC, small number of methods, moderate cohesion, many dependencies) this matches Insufficient Modularization — the class appears not fully decomposed and would likely benefit from further decomposition into smaller classes or collaborators."
