    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=4, nom=1, nopm=1, wmc=1, nof=0. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence that further decomposition (insufficient modularization) is needed."
