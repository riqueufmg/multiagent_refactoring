    "justification": "Class is small and focused: LOC=55, NOM=6 (NOPM=4), fields=2. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although WMC=15 indicates some complexity, the overall size and high cohesion do not indicate an incompletely decomposed class that would benefit from further modularization."
