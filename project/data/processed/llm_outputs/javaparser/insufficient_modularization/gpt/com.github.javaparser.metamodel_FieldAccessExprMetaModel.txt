    "justification": "Class is small and low-complexity: LOC=12, WMC=1, NOM=1 (single method). Although NOF=4, the class size is minimal and LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 show low coupling. DIT=3 (inheritance depth) does not by itself imply the need for further decomposition. These metrics do not justify Insufficient Modularization."
