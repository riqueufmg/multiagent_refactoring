    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively high number of methods (nom=12) and a high weighted method count (wmc=20) despite a small size (loc=63), indicating concentrated complexity and multiple behaviors. It depends on varied concerns (SourcePrinter, TokenTypes, TextElement, LineSeparator, Node, GeneratedJavaParserConstants), which suggests it mixes responsibilities (printing, token handling, lexical preservation, node interaction). Having only 2 fields (nof=2) but many and complex methods implies behavior-heavy design that could be split into clearer modules (e.g., token data vs. printing/lexical logic) to reduce complexity — therefore insufficient modularization is detected."
