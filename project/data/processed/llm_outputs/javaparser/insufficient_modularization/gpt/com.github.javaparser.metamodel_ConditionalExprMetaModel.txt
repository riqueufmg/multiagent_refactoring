    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=11, NOM=1, WMC=1 indicate low size and complexity; NOF=3 fields is minimal; LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show limited coupling. There is no evidence of a large, complex class that needs decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
