    "justification": "Class is very small and low complexity: loc=8, nom=1, wmc=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM is not meaningful for a single-method class (lcom=-1.0). Although DIT is 5, in isolation that deep inheritance does not indicate the class itself is insufficiently modularized; there is no size or complexity evidence that it should be further decomposed."
