    "justification": "The class is minimal and cannot be meaningfully decomposed: LOC=3, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=1 (one field), WMC=0 (no complexity). LCOM=-1.0 and fanin=0/fanout=0 indicate no cohesion or coupling issues that would motivate splitting. Given the lack of methods and very small size, Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
