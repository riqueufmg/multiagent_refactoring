    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.bounds.FalseBound",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=21, WMC=5 (low complexity), NOM=5 with NOPM=4, single field (NOF=1) and LCOM=1.0 indicating high cohesion. Fan-in and fan-out are 0 (low coupling). Given these metrics, there is no evidence the class is insufficiently modularized or needs further decomposition."
