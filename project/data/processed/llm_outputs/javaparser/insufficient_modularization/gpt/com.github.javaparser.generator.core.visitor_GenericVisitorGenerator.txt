    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and cohesive: LOC=12, NOM=2, WMC=2, LCOM=-1.0 (high cohesion). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are few dependencies. Given the low size, low complexity, and high cohesion when analyzed in isolation, there is no evidence that further decomposition is necessary."
