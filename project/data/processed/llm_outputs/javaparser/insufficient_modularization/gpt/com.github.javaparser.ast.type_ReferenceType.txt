    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=38 and nom=10 (small source with short methods), WMC=10 (average complexity ~1 per method) and LCOM=-1.0 (indicates high cohesion). There is no evidence of large implementation complexity or size that would benefit from further decomposition. Although DIT=4 and NC=6 show it sits in a deeper hierarchy and has children, those do not by themselves imply insufficient modularization when the class body is compact and cohesive. Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 also show limited coupling, reducing the need for splitting."
