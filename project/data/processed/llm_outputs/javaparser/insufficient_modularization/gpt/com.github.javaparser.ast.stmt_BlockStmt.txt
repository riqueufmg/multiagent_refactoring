    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.BlockStmt",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has 15 methods (nom=15) concentrated in 83 LOC, a relatively high cyclomatic/complexity weight (wmc=23), and a low cohesion score (lcom=0.6666666666666666) indicating multiple, weakly related responsibilities. The depth in the inheritance tree (dit=4) and the number of external dependencies suggest the class mixes concerns (parsing/metadata, visitor support, range/token handling). Together these metrics indicate the class is large/complex enough and not cohesive enough to justify further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
