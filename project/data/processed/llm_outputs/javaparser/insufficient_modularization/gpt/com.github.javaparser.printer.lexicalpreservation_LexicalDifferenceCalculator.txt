    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.LexicalDifferenceCalculator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC = 328) combined with many methods (NOM = 17) and very high complexity (WMC = 71) indicate it is doing a lot of work that could be split. The dependency list spans many distinct concepts (ConcreteSyntaxModel and many Csm* types, Difference/DifferenceElement/DifferenceElementCalculator, Node/NodeText/ObservableProperty, Change, LineSeparator, GeneratedJavaParserConstants), suggesting multiple responsibilities are mixed in this single class. Presence of an inner type (LexicalDifferenceCalculator.CalculatedSyntaxModel) further indicates embedded sub-responsibilities that could be extracted. These factors together justify that the class has not been fully decomposed and would likely benefit from further modularization."
