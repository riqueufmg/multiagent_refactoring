    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedArrayType",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: small size (loc=66), moderate method count (nom=12), low cohesion value (lcom=0.25) indicating good cohesion, and only moderate complexity (wmc=20). There is a single field (nof=1) and no external coupling reported (fanin=0, fanout=0). These factors suggest the class is reasonably modular and does not require further decomposition."
