    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.types.ResolvedWildcard",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: it has many methods (nom=20) with almost all exposed as public (nopm=19), a sizeable implementation (loc=125) and high implementation complexity (wmc=39). It defines few fields (nof=3) while its methods are numerous, which suggests the class groups multiple operations that are not organized around shared state. The class also depends on several distinct types (ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, Context, ResolvedType, BoundType), indicating multiple responsibilities or concerns. These factors (high method count and complexity, large public API surface, few fields, and cross-cutting dependencies) justify decomposing the class into smaller, more focused modules."
