    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16, all public nopm=16) while only 2 fields (nof=2) and 89 LOC, indicating many behaviors relative to state. Cyclomatic/implementation complexity is moderate-high (wmc=23) and cohesion is low-moderate (lcom=0.625). The high methods-to-fields ratio, number of public methods, non-trivial complexity, and reduced cohesion suggest multiple responsibilities that could be split to reduce size and complexity, i.e. insufficient modularization."
