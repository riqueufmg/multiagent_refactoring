    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a high number of methods (nom = 27) combined with a high complexity burden (WMC = 31) while being fairly large (LOC = 111). Its cohesion metric is moderate/low (LCOM = 0.6296296296296297), indicating methods are not tightly related and may implement multiple responsibilities. The class depends on a wide variety of concerns (several resolver, AST and type-related dependencies), suggesting mixed responsibilities rather than a single focused role. There are only 2 fields (nof = 2) but many methods, which often indicates behavior is concentrated in methods rather than cleanly decomposed stateful collaborators. The depth in the hierarchy (DIT = 5) adds to complexity. These factors together justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
