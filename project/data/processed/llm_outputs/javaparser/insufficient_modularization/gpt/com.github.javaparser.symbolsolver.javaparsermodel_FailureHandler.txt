    "class": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.javaparsermodel.FailureHandler",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show symptoms of Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC=35), few methods (nom=5, public methods=2) and fields (nof=1); high cohesion (LCOM=0.0); no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although WMC=10 indicates some complexity, given the small LOC and low method count there is no clear evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
