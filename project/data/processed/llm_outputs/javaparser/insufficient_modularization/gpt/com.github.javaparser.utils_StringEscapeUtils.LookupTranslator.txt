    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that requires further decomposition: LOC is modest (55), number of methods (nom) = 0 and WMC = 0 (no method complexity), number of fields (nof) = 4 is small, fanin/fanout = 0 and no dependencies. There is no evidence of high size or implementation complexity in the provided data, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
