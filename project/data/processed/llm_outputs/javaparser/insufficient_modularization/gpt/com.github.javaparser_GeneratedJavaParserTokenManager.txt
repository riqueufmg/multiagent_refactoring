    "class": "com.github.javaparser.GeneratedJavaParserTokenManager",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected: the class is excessively large and complex in isolation (loc = 2353, wmc = 1130) with many implementation elements (nom = 54, nof = 124). These metrics indicate concentrated functionality and high conditional/algorithmic complexity that can be reduced by decomposition. Additional context: shallow inheritance (dit = 1) and multiple external dependencies (9 listed) show logic and responsibilities are concentrated in this single class. Although lcom = 0.0 is provided, the sheer size (LOC) and extremely high WMC justify flagging Insufficient Modularization and recommending splitting the class into smaller, focused modules/classes."
