    "justification": "Class is very small and contains no methods or complexity: LOC=7, NOM=0, WMC=0, nof=1, nopf=0. Coupling is nil (fanin=0, fanout=0, no dependencies). LCOM=-1.0 (indicating no cohesion issues for a trivial class). Given the minimal size, lack of behavior, and zero complexity/coupling, there is no evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
