    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=21, 1 method (nom=1), WMC=1. It has few fields (nof=3) and shows high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class does not contain multiple responsibilities or excessive size/complexity that would justify further decomposition. (DIT=12 is noted but, in isolation, does not by itself indicate insufficient modularization.)"
