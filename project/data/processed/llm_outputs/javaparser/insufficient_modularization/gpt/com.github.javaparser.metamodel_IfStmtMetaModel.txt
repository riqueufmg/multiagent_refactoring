    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=15), very low complexity (wmc=1), few methods (nom=1), high cohesion (lcom=0.0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one dependency (com.github.javaparser.metamodel.PropertyMetaModel). Although it has 7 fields (nof=7), the overall low LOC, low complexity and single method suggest the class is already simple and does not require further decomposition."
