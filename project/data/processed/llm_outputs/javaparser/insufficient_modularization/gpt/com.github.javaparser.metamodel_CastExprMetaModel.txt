    "class": "com.github.javaparser.metamodel.CastExprMetaModel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=10, NOF=2, NOM=1, WMC=1 and LCOM=0.0 indicate low size, low complexity and high cohesion. It has no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a single dependency. Given these metrics and analyzing the class in isolation, there is no evidence it has not been decomposed further; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
