    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=11, number of methods=2, WMC=2. It has no fields (nof=0) and shows high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no many public members to split (nopm=2). Given low size, low complexity, high cohesion, and minimal coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity — therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
