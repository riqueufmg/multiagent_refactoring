    "justification": "Class is very small and not complex: LOC=3, WMC=0, NOM=0, no methods/fields (nopf=0, nopm=0), fanin=0, fanout=0. Metrics indicate no internal complexity or size that would benefit from further decomposition; no dependencies are present. Therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
