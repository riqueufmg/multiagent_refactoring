    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=32, NOM=2, NOF=0, NOPF=0. Complexity is moderate but not excessive (WMC=7) and cohesion is high (LCOM=-1.0). There is no evidence of heavy coupling or responsibility spread (fanin=0, fanout=0). Inheritance depth (DIT=3) alone does not imply insufficient modularization. Given the low method count and high cohesion, further decomposition is not justified based on the provided metrics and dependencies."
