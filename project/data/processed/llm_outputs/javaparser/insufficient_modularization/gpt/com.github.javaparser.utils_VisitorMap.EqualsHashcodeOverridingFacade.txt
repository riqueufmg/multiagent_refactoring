    "class": "com.github.javaparser.utils.VisitorMap.EqualsHashcodeOverridingFacade",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is very small and simple (loc=21) with no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), minimal state (nof=1), and zero complexity (wmc=0). It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and a shallow inheritance depth (dit=1). These metrics indicate the class is already lightweight and does not present signs that it needs further decomposition."
