    "justification": "Evidence for Insufficient Modularization: very high size and complexity (loc=423, nom=38, nopm=33) and high cyclomatic/maintenance burden (wmc=128) indicate the class implements many behaviors; low number of fields (nof=4) combined with many public methods suggests procedural consolidation rather than clear decomposition into smaller objects; cohesion is only moderate/low (lcom=0.421) implying methods are not tightly focused on a single responsibility; the dependency list is large and heterogeneous (many distinct AST node types, resolution/logic classes, e.g. MethodCallExpr, ObjectCreationExpr, ArrayAccessExpr, ConditionalExpr, MethodResolutionLogic, FunctionalInterfaceLogic, InferenceContext, etc.), showing the class touches many concerns. Taken in isolation these metrics and the diverse dependencies indicate the class likely groups multiple responsibilities and would benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes or helpers."
