    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=16, NOF=1, NOM=0, WMC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. Metrics indicate no methods, minimal fields, and no coupling to other classes (only dependency to its enclosing class). In isolation it has low size and complexity and does not exhibit characteristics that would benefit from further decomposition."
