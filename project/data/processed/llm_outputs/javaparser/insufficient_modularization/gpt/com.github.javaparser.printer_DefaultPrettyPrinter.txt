    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC = 47 (small size), NOM = 8 and NOPM = 6 (moderate method count), WMC = 8 (moderate complexity), LCOM = 0.25 (good cohesion). Additionally fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 show no high coupling to justify further decomposition. Based on these values the class is not large, overly complex, or poorly cohesive and thus does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
