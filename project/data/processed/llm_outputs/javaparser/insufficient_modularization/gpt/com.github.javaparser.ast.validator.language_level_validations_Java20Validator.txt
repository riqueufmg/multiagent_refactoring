    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=9, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0, NOPF=0. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shows high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). These metrics indicate a single, low‑complexity responsibility and do not suggest further decomposition is needed. (DIT=23 and NC=1 are noted but, in isolation, do not imply internal size/complexity problems.)"
