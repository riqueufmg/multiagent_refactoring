    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=23, NOM=3, NOF=2. Complexity is low (WMC=5) and cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). There is no evidence of many responsibilities or excessive size to justify further decomposition; fanout=0 and nopm=3 also indicate limited external interactions. DIT=3 alone does not indicate insufficient modularization. Therefore no smell detected."
