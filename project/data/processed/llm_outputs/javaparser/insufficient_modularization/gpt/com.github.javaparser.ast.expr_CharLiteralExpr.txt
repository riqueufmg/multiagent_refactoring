    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small (LOC=71) with moderate number of methods (nom=15) and overall complexity equal to method count (WMC=15), indicating mostly simple methods. It has no fields (NOF=0) and no external coupling reported (fanin=0, fanout=0). Depth of inheritance (DIT=6) alone does not imply insufficient modularization. There is no evidence here of a large, monolithic class or high implementation complexity that would require further decomposition."
