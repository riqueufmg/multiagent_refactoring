    "justification": "Class has very small size and no internal complexity: loc=4, nom=0, nof=0, nopm=0, wmc=0, nc=0. No incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). With no methods or fields to decompose and minimal complexity, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization. (LCOM=-1.0 appears not meaningful given absence of members.)"
