    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not overly complex: LOC=22, NOM=4, WMC=5, NOF=2. Cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.5) and coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0, few dependencies). There are no large numbers of methods or fields and overall complexity/size does not suggest an undecomposed class; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
