    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a large public surface (nom = 37, nopm = 37), substantial implementation size (loc = 175) and high cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc = 48). These figures indicate many responsibilities and a complex implementation that could be broken into smaller, focused modules or helper components. Although cohesion appears high (lcom = 0.0), the combination of many methods, large LOC, and high WMC justifies recommending further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity. Fields count (nof = 6) supports the presence of internal state that could be partitioned alongside behavior to improve modularity."
