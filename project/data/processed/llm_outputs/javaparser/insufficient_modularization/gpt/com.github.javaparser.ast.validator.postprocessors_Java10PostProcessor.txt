    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.postprocessors.Java10PostProcessor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization. Metrics show small size and low complexity: loc=29, wmc=4, nom=3, nof=2. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0), and the class has a focused number of methods and fields consistent with a single, cohesive responsibility (lcom=1.0). Given the low implementation complexity and low coupling, there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
