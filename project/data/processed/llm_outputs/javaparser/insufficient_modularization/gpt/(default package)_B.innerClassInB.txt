    "class": "(default package).B.innerClassInB",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modularized: very small size (loc=8), no methods (nom=0) and low complexity (wmc=0), only 2 fields (nof=2), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. LCOM=-1 is due to absence of methods. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
