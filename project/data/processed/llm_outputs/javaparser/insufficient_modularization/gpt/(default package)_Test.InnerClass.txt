    "justification": "The class is minimal and does not exhibit insufficient modularization: LOC=4, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0, DIT=0, LCOM=-1.0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no methods or fields to further decompose, no internal complexity or cohesion issues, and no dependencies, so no further decomposition is warranted."
