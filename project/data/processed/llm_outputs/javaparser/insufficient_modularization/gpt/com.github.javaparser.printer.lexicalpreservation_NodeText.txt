    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.NodeText",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: a high number of methods (nom = 24) and high complexity (wmc = 32) while being fairly large (loc = 124), which indicate substantial implementation responsibility that could be split. It has very few fields (nof = 2, nopf = 1) so the complexity arises from behavior rather than state, suggesting multiple behavioral concerns grouped into one class. Although cohesion is low (lcom = 0.083), the combination of many methods, high cyclomatic complexity and size justifies considering decomposition into smaller classes or collaborators (e.g., separate responsibilities around TextElement, TextElementMatcher and matching/printing logic referenced in dependencies)."
