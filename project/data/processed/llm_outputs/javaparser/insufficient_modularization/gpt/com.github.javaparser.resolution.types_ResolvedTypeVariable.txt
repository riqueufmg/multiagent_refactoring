    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high method count (nom = 17, nopm = 17 — all methods public) combined with high complexity (wmc = 26) concentrated in a relatively small file (loc = 77). It has very few fields (nof = 1) while exposing many behaviors, suggesting multiple responsibilities bundled into one class. Cohesion is not strongly high (lcom = 0.294) and the class depends on several types (ResolvedTypeParameterDeclaration, Context, ResolvedType) which it may be coordinating rather than delegating. These factors indicate the class could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
