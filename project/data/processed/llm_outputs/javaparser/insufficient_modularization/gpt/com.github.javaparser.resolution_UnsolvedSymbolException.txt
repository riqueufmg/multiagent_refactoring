    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=39, NOM=6, WMC=6, NOF=3, NOPF=0. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. DIT=0 and NC=0 show no deep hierarchy pressure to decompose. Fanout=0 and no dependencies suggest no internal complexity from collaborators. These metrics do not indicate an incompletely decomposed class, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
