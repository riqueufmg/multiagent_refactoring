    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=9, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=1, NOPF=1. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and there are no incoming/outgoing coupling edges (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the minimal size and complexity (despite DIT=3), there is no evidence that this class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition in isolation."
