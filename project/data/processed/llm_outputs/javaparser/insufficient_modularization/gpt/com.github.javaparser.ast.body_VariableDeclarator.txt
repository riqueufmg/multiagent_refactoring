    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modularized: high complexity (WMC = 45) and substantial size (LOC = 169) while exposing many operations (NOM = 23, NOPM = 22) — a large public interface suggests multiple responsibilities that could be split. The small number of fields (NOF = 3) combined with many methods implies behavior-heavy design rather than focused, small objects. Depth of inheritance (DIT = 3) increases class responsibility surface. These metrics indicate further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
