    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.StringLiteralExpr",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show evidence of insufficient modularization: size is modest (LOC=71, 14 methods), overall complexity is moderate (WMC=14, average ~1 per method), and cohesion appears acceptable (LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion by the provided metric). Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although DIT is relatively deep (DIT=6), that indicates inheritance depth rather than a large, monolithic class body. Given these metrics and the listed dependencies, there is no strong indication this class should be further decomposed."
