    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected as Insufficient Modularization: the class is small (loc=84) with only 2 fields (nof=2) and 19 relatively small methods (nom=19) giving compact implementation rather than a monolithic one. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.2105), indicating methods are related and do not suggest separable responsibilities. Complexity is moderate (WMC=25) but not extreme for 19 methods, and coupling appears low (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although DIT=4 shows inheritance depth, in isolation there is no strong metric evidence (size, cohesion, or coupling) that the class has not been decomposed and therefore it does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization."
