    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small (LOC=27), has a single field (NOF=1) and only five methods (NOM=5), with moderate complexity (WMC=8). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0), and there are no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). DIT=1 indicates minimal inheritance depth. These metrics show a compact, cohesive class with no clear need for further decomposition."
