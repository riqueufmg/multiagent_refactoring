    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.VoidVisitorWithDefaults",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it declares 105 methods (nom: 105) with a high weighted methods complexity (wmc: 105) concentrated in a single file of 324 LOC, indicating many responsibilities packed in one class. The dependency list contains a very large number of distinct AST node types (e.g., IfStmt, ForStmt, MethodDeclaration, ClassOrInterfaceDeclaration, CompilationUnit, many literal/expr/type/stmt nodes), which implies the class implements visit behavior for many unrelated node kinds rather than being decomposed by concern. DIT is low (1) so this functionality is not distributed through an inheritance hierarchy, and the method count relative to size suggests many small but distinct visit methods concentrated in one place — a classic sign that the class could be split into multiple, more focused visitors or delegate components to reduce size and implementation complexity."
