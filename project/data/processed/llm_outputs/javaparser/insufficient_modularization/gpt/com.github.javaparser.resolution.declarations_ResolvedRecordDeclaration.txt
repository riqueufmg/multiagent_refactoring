    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: LOC is small (33), number of methods is low (nom=7), and cyclomatic/implementation complexity is modest (WMC=7). Cohesion appears high (LCOM=-1.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although DIT is 4, inheritance depth alone does not imply an undecomposed class. There is no evidence in the provided metrics of excessive size, high complexity, or low cohesion that would justify further decomposition."
