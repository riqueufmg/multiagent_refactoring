    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: loc=10, nom=1, nof=2, nopf=2, wmc=1, lcom=0.0. It has no external interaction (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only one dependency. These metrics indicate low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
