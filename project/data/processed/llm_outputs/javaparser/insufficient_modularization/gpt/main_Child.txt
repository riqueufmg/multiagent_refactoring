    "class": "main.Child",

    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=4), only one method (nom=1, nopm=1), low complexity (wmc=1), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), and high cohesion (lcom=-1.0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
