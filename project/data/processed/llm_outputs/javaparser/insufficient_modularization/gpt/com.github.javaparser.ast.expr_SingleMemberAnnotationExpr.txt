    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected because the class shows signs of insufficient modularization: 14 methods (nom = 14) with all of them public (nopm = 14) concentrated in a small source (loc = 69) indicates many responsibilities packed into one class; high complexity (wmc = 18) combined with low cohesion (lcom = 0.714) implies methods are not strongly related and the class could be split into smaller, more focused units; there is only one field (nof = 1) so methods operate largely independently rather than around shared state, reinforcing the chance of multiple responsibilities; deep inheritance (dit = 5) and involvement with many concerns (dependencies include visitor, meta-model, expression and node types) further suggest this class mixes roles that could be modularized. These elements together justify marking this class as insufficiently modularized."
