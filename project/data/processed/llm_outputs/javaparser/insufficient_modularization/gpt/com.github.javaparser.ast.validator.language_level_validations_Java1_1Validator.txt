    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: 14 LOC, 1 method (nom=1), 1 field (nof=1), and low cyclomatic/implementation complexity (wmc=1). Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0) and it has no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). It has only two external dependencies and a single public method (nopm=1). These metrics indicate a single, well-scoped responsibility rather than an undecomposed large class, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
