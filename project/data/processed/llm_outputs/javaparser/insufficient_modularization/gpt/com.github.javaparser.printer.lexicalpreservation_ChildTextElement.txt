    "class": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.ChildTextElement",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High number of methods (nom=21, public methods=18) combined with high method complexity (WMC=23) while maintaining almost no internal state (nof=1) and small overall size (LOC=73). Moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.476) indicates the class groups multiple responsibilities rather than a single cohesive role. These factors together suggest the class has not been fully decomposed and would benefit from further modularization (splitting responsibilities or extracting helper classes)."
