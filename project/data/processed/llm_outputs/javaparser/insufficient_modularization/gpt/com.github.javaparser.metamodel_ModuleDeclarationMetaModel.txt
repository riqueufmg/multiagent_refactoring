    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=12, WMC=1, NOM=1, and NOPF/NOF=4 fields but overall size is low. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Low coupling: fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency listed. DIT=2 is modest. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition."
