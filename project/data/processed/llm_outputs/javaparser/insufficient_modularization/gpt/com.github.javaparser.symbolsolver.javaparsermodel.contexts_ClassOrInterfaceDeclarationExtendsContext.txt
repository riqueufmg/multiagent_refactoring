    "justification": "The class is small and focused: LOC=16, number of methods (nom)=2, WMC=4 (low complexity). It has no fields (nof=0) and shows low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1 indicates good cohesion. Given its small size, low complexity, and cohesion, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
