    "justification": "Class is not insufficiently modular: very small (loc=10), no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and dit=0. These metrics indicate minimal size and responsibility when considered in isolation, so no further decomposition is warranted."
