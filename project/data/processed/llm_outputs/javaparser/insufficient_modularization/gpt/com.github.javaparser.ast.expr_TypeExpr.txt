    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.expr.TypeExpr",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it defines 14 methods (nom=14) all exposed as public (nopm=14) while having only 1 field (nof=1), indicating many behaviors without internal state separation. Complexity is moderate/high (wmc=18) for a 69-line class (loc=69). Cohesion is low (lcom=0.7142857142857143), suggesting the methods do not form a single tightly related responsibility. The class also references many distinct external concerns (dependencies include visitor interfaces, observer support, meta-model, token/range, and Type), implying it mixes responsibilities (visiting, observing, meta-model interaction, and type-related logic). Taken together these metrics justify that the class is a candidate for further decomposition into smaller, more cohesive classes or collaborators."
