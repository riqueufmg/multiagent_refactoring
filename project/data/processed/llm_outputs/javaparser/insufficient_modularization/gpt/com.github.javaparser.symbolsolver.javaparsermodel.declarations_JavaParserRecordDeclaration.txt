    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 401), high implementation complexity (wmc = 85), many methods (nom = 50) with almost all public (nopm = 47) indicating multiple responsibilities exposed, and a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 8). The deep inheritance (dit = 5) increases conceptual complexity. Although LCOM = 0.3 suggests some cohesion, the combination of high LOC, high WMC, and large public surface area plus dependencies across diverse concerns (AST node types, resolution/types, factory and utility classes) strongly suggests the class has not been fully decomposed and could be split into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and complexity."
