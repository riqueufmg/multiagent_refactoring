    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=9, nom=1, nof=1, LCOM=0.0. Low complexity and maintainability risk: WMC=1. Low coupling: fanout=0, fanin=0, single dependency (PropertyMetaModel). DIT=4 only indicates inheritance depth but with the very small size and single method/field there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
