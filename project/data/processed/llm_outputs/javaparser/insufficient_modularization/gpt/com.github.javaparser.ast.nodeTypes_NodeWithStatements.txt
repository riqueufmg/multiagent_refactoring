    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: LOC is small (65), so the overall size is limited; NOM = 16 yields ~4 LOC/method on average, implying many short methods rather than a monolithic implementation; WMC = 17 is moderate and proportional to LOC; LCOM = -1.0 indicates high cohesion among methods (no sign of unrelated responsibilities); fan-in/fan-out = 0 indicates low coupling and no extensive external responsibilities. Together these elements suggest the class is reasonably modular in isolation, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
