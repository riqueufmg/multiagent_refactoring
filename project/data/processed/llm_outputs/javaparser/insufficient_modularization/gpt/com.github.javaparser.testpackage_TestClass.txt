    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=6, NOM=2, WMC=2. It has no external interactions (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]), no subclasses (DIT=0, NC=0), and LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Given the low size and complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity; Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
