    "class": "com.github.javaparser.generator.metamodel.MetaModelGenerator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Evidence of insufficient modularization: large size (LOC=185) with relatively many methods (NOM=8, NOPM=3) and moderate complexity (WMC=10); low cohesion (LCOM=0.625) indicating multiple responsibilities within the class; several fields (NOF=3) and many external collaborators (15 dependencies) suggesting the class handles diverse concerns. These metrics together indicate the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
