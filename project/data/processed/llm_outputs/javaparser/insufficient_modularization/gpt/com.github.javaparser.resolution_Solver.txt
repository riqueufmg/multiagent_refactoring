    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, large, or complex class: loc is only 27 (very small); nom = 13 but wmc = 13 (methods are simple, complexity per method is low); lcom = -1.0 indicates high cohesion of the methods; fanin/fanout = 0 show no coupling evidence in the given data. Together these suggest the class is small and cohesive, so there is not sufficient evidence of Insufficient Modularization (further decomposition is unlikely to reduce size or complexity)."
