    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=5, nom=1, wmc=1. Cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0) and there are no reported incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). The class has a single method and minimal dependencies (WoolRenderer). These elements show no evidence of a class that needs further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
