    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and cohesive so further decomposition is not indicated. Metrics: LOC=55, NOM=5, NOF=2 show limited size and surface area; LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion; DIT=0 and NC=0 show no deep hierarchy or nested-class complexity; Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 indicate low coupling. WMC=13 is moderate but, given the low LOC and small number of methods, does not by itself imply the need to split the class. Based on these elements taken in isolation, the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
