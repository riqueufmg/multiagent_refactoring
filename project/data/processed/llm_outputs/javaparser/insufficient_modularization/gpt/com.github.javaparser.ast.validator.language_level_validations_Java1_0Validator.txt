    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator.language_level_validations.Java1_0Validator",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High number of fields (nof=30) combined with a very small interface (nom=1, nopm=1) — many data elements but only a single method suggests multiple responsibilities or data groups are combined in one class rather than split. Moderate size (loc=125) despite only one method reinforces that the class contains substantial content that could be factored out. Dependencies on Validator and SingleNodeTypeValidator indicate natural decomposition points (separate validator components). The imbalance between fields and methods is the primary indicator of insufficient modularization."
