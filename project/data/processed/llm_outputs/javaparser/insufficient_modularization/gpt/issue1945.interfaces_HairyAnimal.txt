    "class": "issue1945.interfaces.HairyAnimal",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=3, NOM=1, WMC=1, NOF=0, NOPF=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, DIT=0, NC=0. It has a single method, no fields, and no incoming/outgoing coupling beyond one dependency (issue1945.interfaces.HairType). These metrics indicate low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further or that further modularization is needed."
