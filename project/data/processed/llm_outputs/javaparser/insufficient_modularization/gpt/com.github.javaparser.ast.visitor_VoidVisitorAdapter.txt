    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor.VoidVisitorAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: very high number of methods (nom = 103), large size (loc = 536), and high implementation complexity (wmc = 104). It references a very large set of distinct types (~107 dependencies) suggesting it handles many different AST node kinds / responsibilities. Inheritance depth is shallow (dit = 1) and it has few mechanisms for decomposition (nc = 7), while cohesion metric is present (lcom = -1.0). These elements together indicate the class is large, complex, and likely responsible for multiple concerns and should be further decomposed."
