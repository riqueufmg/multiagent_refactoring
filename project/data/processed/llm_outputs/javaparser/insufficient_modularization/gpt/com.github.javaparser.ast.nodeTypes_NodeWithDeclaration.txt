    "justification": "Class shows low size and complexity: LOC=31, NOM=3, WMC=3. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is 0 (DIT=0). Cohesion metric (LCOM=-1.0) indicates high cohesion. Given the small number of methods and low complexity, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
