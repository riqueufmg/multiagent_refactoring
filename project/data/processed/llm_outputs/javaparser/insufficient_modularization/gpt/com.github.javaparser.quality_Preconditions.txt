    "class": "com.github.javaparser.quality.Preconditions",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: it is small and simple (LOC=40), has a small number of methods (nom=5, nopm=4), low complexity (WMC=6), and very high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0). There are no fields (nof=0) and no coupling to other code (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and cohesive, so further decomposition is not warranted."
