    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exposes a relatively large number of methods (nom=7, nopm=6) while holding almost no state (nof=1) and shows maximum LCOM (1.0), indicating its methods do not share common state and likely implement separate responsibilities. Although overall size is small (loc=27) and complexity per method is moderate (wmc=7), the combination of many public methods with low shared state and zero coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests the class groups independent behavior that could be split into smaller, more focused modules."
