    "class": "com.github.javaparser.ast.stmt.SwitchStmt",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large public API (nom=18, nopm=18) and non-trivial implementation size (loc=111) with high method complexity (wmc=29). Cohesion is moderate-to-low (lcom=0.5556) while the class has very few fields (nof=2), implying many methods operate on different concerns rather than shared state. In addition, a non-trivial inheritance depth (dit=4) increases responsibility surface. These metrics together indicate the class likely groups multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
