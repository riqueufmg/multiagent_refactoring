    "class": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.logic.MethodResolutionLogic",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits characteristics of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc = 803), very high complexity (WMC = 211), and many methods (nom = 31, with 13 public methods) which indicates multiple responsibilities and a large implementation surface. It depends on a wide set of external types (18 distinct dependency types listed) suggesting it handles varied concerns. It has no inheritance decomposition (dit = 0, nc = 0) to distribute responsibilities. Although LCOM = 0.1935 indicates some cohesion, the combination of large LOC, high WMC, many methods, many public methods, and numerous external dependencies justifies that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and is a candidate for further modularization."
