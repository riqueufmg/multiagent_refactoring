    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and simple (loc=10, nom=1, wmc=1, nof=0) with no fields and minimal behaviour, so there is nothing to decompose. Coupling is negligible (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it depends only on com.github.javaparser.resolution.declarations.ResolvedReferenceTypeDeclaration. Cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0). While dit=3 and nc=5 are present, they do not by themselves indicate that this class is insufficiently modular. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
