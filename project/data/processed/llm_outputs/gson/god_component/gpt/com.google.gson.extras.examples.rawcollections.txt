    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and 38 LOC in total (RawCollectionsExample: 27 LOC, Event: 11 LOC). Class metrics are small (low WMC, no complex methods, minimal fan-in/fan-out) and there is no indication of a single class or the package aggregating excessive responsibilities or excessive size. Dependency footprint is minimal. Based on these elements, the package is not a God Component."
