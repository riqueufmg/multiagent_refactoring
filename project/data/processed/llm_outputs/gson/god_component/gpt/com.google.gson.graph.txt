    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.gson.graph",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package has 4 classes and 403 LOC — not an excessive number of classes or overwhelmingly large size for a component. Although GraphAdapterBuilder is the largest class (228 LOC) and Factory is moderately sized (112 LOC), the remaining inner classes are small (40 LOC and 23 LOC), so size is concentrated but the overall package is modest. Additionally the package has no incoming coupling (Ca = 0) and a small set of external dependencies, indicating it is not an overly dominant/cohesive god component. Therefore this package does not qualify as a God Component based on the provided data."
