    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 33 classes and 577 LOC, which is large for a single component in this codebase. A single class (Main) accounts for 173 LOC and 19 methods (high complexity within the package), and there are many nested/related classes concentrated in the same package. The package is largely self-contained (Ca = 0, Ce = 2) so responsibility is centralized here. These facts — high class count and substantial LOC concentrated in one package (including a notably large Main class) — support the detection of a God Component."
