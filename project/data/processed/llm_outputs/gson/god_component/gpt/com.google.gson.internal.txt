    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.gson.internal",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 30 classes and 2,464 LOC, indicating a large component surface. Several very large and complex classes concentrate much of that size: LinkedTreeMap (504 LOC, WMC 58) and GsonTypes (483 LOC, WMC 80), plus ConstructorConstructor (262 LOC, WMC 47). A single file (LinkedTreeMap) also defines multiple nested types (Node, Iterator, EntrySet, KeySet), increasing class/count density in one component. The combination of high total LOC, many classes, and a few very large/complex classes supports the conclusion that this package functions as a God Component. "
