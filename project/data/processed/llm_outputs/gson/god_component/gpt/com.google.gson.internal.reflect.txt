    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package has 299 LOC across 4 classes but is dominated by ReflectionHelper (218 LOC, ~73% of package LOC). ReflectionHelper also has high internal complexity and size (16 methods, WMC 23, 12 parameters across methods), while the other nested/helper classes are very small (9, 55, 17 LOC). This concentrated size and responsibility in a single class indicates the package contains a God Component that centralizes excessive functionality."
