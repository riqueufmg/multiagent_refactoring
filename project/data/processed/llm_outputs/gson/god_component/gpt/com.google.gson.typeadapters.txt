    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 4 classes and 409 LOC in total, which is not excessively large for a package. Although two classes are relatively large/complex (UtcDateTypeAdapter: 208 LOC, WMC 29; RuntimeTypeAdapterFactory: 129 LOC, WMC 30), the size/complexity is concentrated in a couple of classes rather than the package as a whole. Coupling is low (Ca=0, Ce=3). Therefore, while individual classes may warrant refactoring (high WMC, many methods), the package does not constitute a God Component."
