    "smell": "God Component",

    "justification": "The package contains 32 classes and 3,235 LOC, with a strong concentration of size and complexity in a few very large classes: Gson (826 LOC, 51 methods, WMC 104), GsonBuilder (454 LOC, 35 methods, WMC 52), JsonArray (281 LOC), JsonElement (227 LOC), JsonPrimitive (215 LOC) and JsonObject (167 LOC). These large classes account for a large portion of the package's code and responsibilities, and Gson in particular has high cyclomatic complexity and many methods, indicating an aggregation of functionality. Given the overall package size and the concentration of complexity in a small number of classes, the package qualifies as a God Component."
