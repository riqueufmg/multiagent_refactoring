    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class (TypeToken) with 285 LOC, 22 methods (nom) and WMC=64. While the class concentrates complexity (WMC and method count), the package is not excessively large by LOC nor composed of many classes. Coupling shows the class is reused (Ca=9) but efferent coupling is low (Ce=1). Given the single-class package and moderate size, the evidence does not indicate an excessively large component that would qualify as a God Component."
