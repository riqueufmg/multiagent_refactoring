    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package is small: num_classes=3 and total loc=65. Individual classes are small (InterceptorFactory loc=34, InterceptorAdapter loc=21, JsonPostDeserializer loc=10) with low complexity (wmc 2, 0, 1), low fanin/fanout and no indication of a very large number of contained classes. Package coupling is modest (Ce=3, Ca=0) and there are no signs of a single oversized class or overwhelmingly large component. Based on these metrics and contextual judgment, this package does not qualify as a God Component."
