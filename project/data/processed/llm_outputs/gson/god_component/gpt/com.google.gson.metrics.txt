    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 22 classes and 831 LOC, indicating substantial size for a single component. Several large, complex classes concentrate most of the code: ParseBenchmark is 295 LOC and includes many nested types (Document, Api, Parser, GsonStreamParser, GsonSkipParser, JacksonStreamParser, GsonDomParser, GsonBindParser, JacksonBindParser, Tweet, User, Feed, Link, Item, Content, ReaderUser), CollectionsDeserializationBenchmark is 107 LOC (WMC 23) and BagOfPrimitivesDeserializationBenchmark is 91 LOC (WMC 20). The presence of multiple high-LOC and high-WMC classes plus many nested classes suggests the package aggregates multiple responsibilities rather than being focused, consistent with a God Component smell."
