    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.gson.protobuf",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and 308 LOC overall, which is small for a component. The largest class, ProtoTypeAdapter, is 243 LOC with WMC 32 and 9 methods—moderate complexity but not overwhelmingly large. The other nested types (Builder 55 LOC, EnumSerialization 10 LOC) are small. Coupling metrics are low (Ce=1, Ca=0, fanin/fanout zeros), and there is no evidence of an excessive number of classes or massively large LOC concentrated beyond a single moderately sized adapter class. Therefore this package does not meet the contextual threshold for a God Component."
