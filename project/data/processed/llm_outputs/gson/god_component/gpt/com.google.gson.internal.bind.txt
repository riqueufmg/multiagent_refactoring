    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 30 classes and 3,316 LOC total, which is large for a single component. Several classes within the package are very large and complex (e.g. TypeAdapters: 681 LOC, 51 fields, WMC 126; ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory: 407 LOC, WMC 56; JavaTimeTypeAdapters: 317 LOC, WMC 82; JsonTreeReader: 285 LOC, WMC 70), and multiple classes contain many methods and nested types. The concentration of size and complexity in multiple oversized classes indicates the package centralizes too much responsibility and is excessively large by both LOC and number of classes, matching the God Component smell."
