    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 27 classes with a total of 17,618 LOC, which is very large for a single component. A single top-level class and its nested types dominate the package: Bag (LOC 6101) plus large nested types such as Bag.ProtoWithAnnotations (LOC 2361), Bag.InnerMessage (LOC 1413), Bag.ProtoWithRepeatedFields (LOC 876), Bag.ProtoWithAnnotationsAndJsonNames (LOC 846), Bag.OuterMessage (LOC 630) and multiple Builder inner classes (hundreds of LOC each). The bulk of the package's code is concentrated in these few, very large classes, creating a monolithic, excessively large component (despite low external coupling Ce=0/Ca=0), which matches the God Component smell."
