    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.util",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class (num_classes=1) with 264 LOC. While the class ISO8601Utils concentrates the package's code (class loc=264) and shows moderate internal complexity (wmc=38, nom=9), it has low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and reasonable cohesion (lcom=0.222). The size is moderate for a self-contained formatter/parser utility and there is not an excessive number of classes or extraordinarily large LOC that would indicate a God Component. Therefore, based on the provided metrics, this does not qualify as a God Component."
