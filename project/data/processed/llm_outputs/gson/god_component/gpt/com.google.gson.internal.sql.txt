    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.gson.internal.sql",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 4 classes and a total of 166 LOC, with individual class LOCs of 51, 45, 25, and 45. Complexity and size per class are low (WMC ranges ~3–6, NOM 3–4), and class-level coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Package-level coupling is modest (Ce=3, Ca=1). No single class or the package as a whole exhibits excessive size or concentration of responsibilities, so it does not qualify as a God Component."
