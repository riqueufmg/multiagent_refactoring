    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package totals 1,839 LOC across 5 classes, but is overwhelmingly concentrated in two classes: JsonReader (1,244 LOC, 46 methods, WMC 329) and JsonWriter (503 LOC, 39 methods, WMC 81), which together account for ~95% of the package LOC. The very high LOC, method counts and complexity metrics for these classes indicate excessive size and likely multiple responsibilities concentrated in a small number of components. Additionally the package has a non-trivial afferent coupling (Ca=8), increasing the impact of such large classes. These factors support detecting a God Component."
