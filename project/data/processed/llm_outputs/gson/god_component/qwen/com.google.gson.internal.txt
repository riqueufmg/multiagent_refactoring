    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 30 classes with a total of 2464 lines of code. While the package has a considerable number of classes and LOC, the metrics do not indicate an excessively large component. The classes appear to be logically grouped under the 'internal' package, suggesting a cohesive purpose related to Gson's internal workings. There is no evidence of a single class or component monopolizing functionality or being excessively large in comparison to others."
