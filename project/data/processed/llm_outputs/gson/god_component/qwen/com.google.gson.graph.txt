    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 4 classes with a total of 403 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The largest class, GraphAdapterBuilder, has 228 lines of code and 5 methods, which is manageable. The other classes are significantly smaller (112, 23, and 40 lines respectively), indicating a reasonable distribution of functionality. There is no indication that any single component is excessively large or taking on too many responsibilities."
