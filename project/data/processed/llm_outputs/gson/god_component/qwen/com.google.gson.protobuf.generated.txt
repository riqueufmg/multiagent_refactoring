    "justification": "The package contains a single class 'Bag' with 6101 lines of code and numerous inner classes, making it excessively large. The total package LOC is 17618 across 27 classes, indicating a concentration of functionality within the 'Bag' class and its generated components. This centralization of logic and excessive size qualifies as a God Component."
