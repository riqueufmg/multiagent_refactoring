    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 33 classes with a total of 577 lines of code, which is not excessively large for a package. The largest class, Main, has 173 lines of code and 19 methods, which is substantial but not indicative of a God Component. The distribution of classes and responsibilities appears reasonable without a single component dominating the codebase."
