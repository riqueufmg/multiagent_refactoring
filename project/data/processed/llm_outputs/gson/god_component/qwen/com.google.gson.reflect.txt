    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class (TypeToken) with 285 lines of code, which is not excessively large. The class has reasonable complexity with 22 methods and a WMC of 64. The package has 9 afferent couplings indicating usage but this alone does not indicate god component smell. The size and complexity are within reasonable limits for a utility reflection package."
