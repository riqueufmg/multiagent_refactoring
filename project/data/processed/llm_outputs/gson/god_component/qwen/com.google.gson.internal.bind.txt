    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.gson.internal.bind",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 30 classes with a total of 3316 lines of code, indicating a high level of complexity and responsibility. Several classes within the package are also large in terms of LOC and WMC (e.g., TypeAdapters with 681 LOC and WMC of 126, JsonTreeReader with 285 LOC and WMC of 70, ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory with 407 LOC and WMC of 56), suggesting that the package and its classes are handling excessive functionality. The high number of classes and their cumulative size imply that the package is managing too much responsibility, which aligns with the characteristics of a God Component."
