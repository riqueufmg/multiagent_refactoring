    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 4 classes with a total of 166 lines of code, which is not excessively large. None of the individual classes exhibit an unusually high number of methods, fields, or lines of code that would indicate a God Component. The complexity metrics (WMC, LCOM) and size metrics (LOC, NOM, NOF) are within reasonable limits, and there is no indication of excessive responsibility or centralization of functionality."
