    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class, JsonReader, which is excessively large with 1244 lines of code and 46 methods. This class also has a high Weighted Method Count (WMC) of 329, indicating high complexity. The package as a whole has a low number of classes (5), but the dominance of a single class in terms of size and complexity indicates a God Component smell."
