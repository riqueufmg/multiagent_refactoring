    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes with a total of 308 lines of code. The largest class, ProtoTypeAdapter, has 243 lines of code and 9 methods, which is not excessively large in the context of a specialized adapter implementation. The package and class metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would characterize a God Component."
