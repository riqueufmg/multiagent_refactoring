    "justification": "The package contains 22 classes and 831 lines of code, which is not excessively large for a metrics package. The largest class, ParseBenchmark, has 295 lines of code and contains several inner classes, but this is contextual to its purpose as a benchmarking utility. There is no single class that dominates the codebase or takes on responsibilities beyond its scope."
