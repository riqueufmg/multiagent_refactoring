    "justification": "The package contains only 4 classes with a total of 299 lines of code. The largest class, ReflectionHelper, has 218 lines of code and 16 methods, which is not excessively large in the context of the package. The other classes are significantly smaller, indicating a reasonable distribution of responsibilities. There is no evidence of a single component monopolizing functionality or being excessively large."
