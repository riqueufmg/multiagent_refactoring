{
    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.gson",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 32 classes with a total of 3235 lines of code. While the package has a substantial size, the classes are logically grouped under the Gson library's core functionality for JSON processing. Key classes like Gson (826 LOC) and GsonBuilder (454 LOC) are large but serve central roles in the library and are appropriately cohesive. The distribution of responsibilities across multiple classes indicates a well-organized structure rather than a single God Component."
