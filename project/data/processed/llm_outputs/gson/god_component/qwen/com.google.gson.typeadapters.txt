    "justification": "The package contains only 4 classes with a total of 409 lines of code. The largest class, UtcDateTypeAdapter, has 208 lines of code and a WMC of 29, which is not excessively large for a single class. The other classes are significantly smaller, with the next largest being RuntimeTypeAdapterFactory at 129 lines of code. The package does not exhibit excessive size in terms of either the number of classes or lines of code, nor does any individual class show signs of being a God Component."
