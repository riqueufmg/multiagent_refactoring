    "justification": "Package contains 30 classes and 3316 LOC, which is excessively large. Several individual classes are very large and complex (e.g., TypeAdapters with 681 LOC and 126 WMC, ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory with 407 LOC, JavaTimeTypeAdapters with 317 LOC), indicating the package handles too many responsibilities."
