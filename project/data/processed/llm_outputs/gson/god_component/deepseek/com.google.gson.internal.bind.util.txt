    "justification": "The package contains only one class with 264 LOC and 9 methods, which is a focused utility component. The LOC and method count are moderate, and the class has a single responsibility related to ISO8601 date handling. The low coupling (Ca=1, Ce=0) and absence of dependencies further indicate it is not excessively large or complex."
