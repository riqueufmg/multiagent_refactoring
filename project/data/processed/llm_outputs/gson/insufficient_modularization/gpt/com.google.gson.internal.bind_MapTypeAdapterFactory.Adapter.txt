    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the class has 112 LOC, other metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: number of fields is small (nof=3), there are no methods reported (nom=0) and no measured complexity (wmc=0), cohesion metric is strongly favorable (lcom=-1.0), coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (dit=1). The low coupling, high cohesion and absence of internal method complexity do not support a diagnosis of Insufficient Modularization."
