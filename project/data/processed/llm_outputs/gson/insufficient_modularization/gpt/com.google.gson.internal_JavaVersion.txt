    "justification": "Class is small and reasonably cohesive: loc=69, nom=7, wmc=12 (moderate complexity but not excessive), lcom=0.4286 (acceptable cohesion). It has a single field (nof=1) with no public fields (nopf=0) and a small public surface (nopm=2). No incoming or outgoing coupling is reported (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the modest size, moderate complexity, and reasonable cohesion, there is no strong evidence that the class requires further decomposition."
