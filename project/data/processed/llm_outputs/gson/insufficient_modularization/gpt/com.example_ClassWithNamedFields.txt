    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=7, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=2, LCOM=0.0 (indicating high cohesion). There is no inheritance (DIT=0) and no coupling to other code (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). These metrics indicate the class is already simple and well-focused, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
