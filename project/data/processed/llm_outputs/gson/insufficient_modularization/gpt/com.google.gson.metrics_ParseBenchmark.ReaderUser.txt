    "justification": "The class is not an instance of Insufficient Modularization: it is very small (LOC=6), has only 1 field (nof=1) and no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), zero measured complexity (WMC=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate there is nothing large or complex to decompose; LCOM=-1.0 does not suggest poor cohesion that would require further modularization."
