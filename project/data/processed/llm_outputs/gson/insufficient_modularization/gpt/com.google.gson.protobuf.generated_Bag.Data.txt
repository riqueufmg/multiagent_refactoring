    "justification": "LOC is very large (loc=551) while the class holds many fields (nof=15, nopf=3), indicating substantial internal size and state. There are no declared methods (nom=0, nopm=0) so behavior is concentrated rather than decomposed. The cohesion metric is lcom=-1.0 (undefined/poor cohesion) and the class has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), meaning the complexity is contained within this single class. These factors together indicate Insufficient Modularization."
