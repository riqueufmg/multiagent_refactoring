    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag.SimpleProto",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: large size (loc = 472) combined with many fields (nof = 12) but no methods (nom = 0) indicates substantial content that is not decomposed into smaller behavioral units. Presence of public fields (nopf = 2) reduces encapsulation and suggests responsibilities are not cleanly separated. wmc = 0 and fanin/fanout = 0 show little method-level structure or interactions despite the class size. These elements together justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
