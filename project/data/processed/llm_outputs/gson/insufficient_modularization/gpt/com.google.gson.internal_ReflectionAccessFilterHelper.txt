    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.ReflectionAccessFilterHelper",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has 8 methods (nom=8) and 75 lines of code (loc=75) with a moderate complexity (wmc=10), yet only 1 field (nof=1) and a high lack-of-cohesion score (lcom=1.0). The combination of many methods relative to a single field and LCOM=1.0 indicates methods are not cohesive and the class likely mixes responsibilities. The presence of an inner dependency (AccessChecker) further suggests separable functionality that could be extracted. These elements justify decomposing the class into smaller, more cohesive units."
