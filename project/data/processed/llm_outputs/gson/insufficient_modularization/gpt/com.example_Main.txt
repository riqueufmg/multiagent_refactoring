    "class": "com.example.Main",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is likely insufficiently modularized: it has high size (loc = 173) and many methods (nom = 19) with substantial complexity (wmc = 19). Only one public method (nopm = 1) combined with no fields (nof = 0) indicates many non-public/helper methods grouped in a single class rather than separated into cohesive modules. The class depends on a wide variety of unrelated types (com.google.gson.Gson, com.google.gson.GsonBuilder, com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken, many com.example.* classes and enums), suggesting multiple responsibilities. These metrics together justify that the class should be decomposed into smaller modules/classes to reduce size and complexity."
