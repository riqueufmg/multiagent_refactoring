    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: loc=61 (not large), nof=4 (few fields), nom=0 and wmc=0 (no methods / no internal complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling to analyze). There is no evidence of high size, high complexity, or multiple responsibilities that would justify further decomposition in isolation."
