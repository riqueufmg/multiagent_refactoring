    "class": "com.example.ClassWithSerializedName",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=7, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=2. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). No inheritance depth (DIT=0, NC=0). These metrics indicate low size and low complexity, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
