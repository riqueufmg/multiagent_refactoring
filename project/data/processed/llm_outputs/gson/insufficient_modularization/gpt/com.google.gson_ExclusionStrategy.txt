    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: very small size (LOC=23), low number of methods (nom=2), low complexity (WMC=2), single class-level cohesion (lcom=-1.0 suggests high cohesion), no inheritance complexity (dit=0), and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) aside from one dependency (FieldAttributes). These values show the class is small, cohesive, and simple, so there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
