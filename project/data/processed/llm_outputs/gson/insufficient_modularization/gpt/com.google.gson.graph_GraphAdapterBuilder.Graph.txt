    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=23, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=3 (few fields), WMC=0 (no complexity). Coupling is nil (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 reflects no method-level cohesion to evaluate. Given the lack of methods, low size, zero complexity and no coupling, there is no evidence this class is insufficiently modularized or would benefit from further decomposition."
