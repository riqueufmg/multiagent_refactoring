    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=67, NOM=5 (NOPM=4), WMC=7 and LCOM=-1.0 indicate low complexity and high cohesion. Inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1) and there are no incoming/outgoing coupling signals (fanin=0, fanout=0). Limited external dependencies (JsonParseException, NumberLimits, JsonReader) and modest method count do not suggest further decomposition is needed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
