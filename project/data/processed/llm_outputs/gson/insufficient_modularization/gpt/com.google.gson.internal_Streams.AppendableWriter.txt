{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.Streams.AppendableWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No: the class shows no signs of insufficient modularization when considered in isolation. Metrics show 0 methods (nom=0) and only 4 fields (nof=4), very low complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no inheritance depth (dit=0). Although LOC=65, the lack of methods and low complexity/coupling provide no evidence that the class is too large or should be decomposed further."
