    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.ProtoTypeAdapter.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not show signs of insufficient modularization: its size is moderate (loc=55), complexity metrics are minimal (wmc=0, nom=0), coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0), and it has a limited number of fields (nof=6). There is no evidence of high implementation complexity or large method count that would justify further decomposition. LCOM is -1.0 (not informative) but other metrics consistently indicate no need to split the class."
