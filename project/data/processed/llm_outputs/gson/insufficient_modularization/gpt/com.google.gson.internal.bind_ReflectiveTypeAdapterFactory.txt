    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size and complexity (loc=407, wmc=56) with many fields and methods (nof=17, nom=14, nopm=5). It has moderate cohesion (lcom=0.357) while depending on numerous distinct concerns (reflection/ConstructorConstructor/ReflectionHelper/ReflectionAccessFilterHelper, field binding/ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory.FieldsData/BoundField, JSON I/O/JsonReader/JsonWriter/JsonToken, type handling/TypeToken/Primitives/GsonTypes, adapters/TypeAdapter/JsonAdapterAnnotationTypeAdapterFactory, exclusion/Excluder, naming/FieldNamingStrategy, object construction/ObjectConstructor, error handling/JsonParseException, and Gson core). These factors indicate multiple responsibilities are mixed in one class and that further decomposition (e.g., separate field-binding, reflection utilities, adapter-creation, and I/O handling) could reduce its size and implementation complexity."
