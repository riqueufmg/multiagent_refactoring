    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.JavaTimeTypeAdapters",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modularized: it has a large size (LOC = 317) and many methods (nom = 33, nopm = 12) combined with high overall complexity (WMC = 82). It also has multiple fields (nof = 10) and a high lack-of-cohesion score (LCOM = 0.8787878787878788), indicating responsibilities are spread across unrelated methods. These metrics (high LOC, high method count, high WMC, and high LCOM) together justify that the class likely contains multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive classes or modules."
