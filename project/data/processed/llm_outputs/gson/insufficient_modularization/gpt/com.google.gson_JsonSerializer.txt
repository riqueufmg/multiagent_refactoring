    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: loc=15, nom=1 (only one method), wmc=1 (very low complexity), lcom=-1.0 (high cohesion). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has only two dependencies (com.google.gson.JsonElement, com.google.gson.JsonSerializationContext). Given its size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that it needs further decomposition."
