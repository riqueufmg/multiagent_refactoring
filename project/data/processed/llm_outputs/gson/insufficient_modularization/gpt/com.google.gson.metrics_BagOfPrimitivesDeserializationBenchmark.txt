    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.BagOfPrimitivesDeserializationBenchmark",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small set of members and responsibilities (nof=2 fields, nom=5 methods, nopm=4 public methods) and a moderate size (loc=91). Although WMC=20 indicates some internal complexity, it is distributed over only five methods (average complexity ~4) and does not by itself imply an undecomposed monolith. Cohesion is reasonable (lcom=0.4), and there is no inheritance depth (dit=0) or external coupling indicated (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics in isolation, there is no clear evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed or that splitting it would reduce size or complexity."
