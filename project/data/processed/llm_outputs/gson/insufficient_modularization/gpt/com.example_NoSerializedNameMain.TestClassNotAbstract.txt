    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is already minimal: loc=3, nof=1 (nopf=1), nom=0 (nopm=0), wmc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods and only a single field, showing very low size and complexity. These values do not suggest that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity, so Insufficient Modularization is unlikely."
