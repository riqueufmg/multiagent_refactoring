    "justification": "The class is a likely case of Insufficient Modularization: very large size (LOC = 1413) combined with many fields (NOF = 37, NOPF = 9) while having no methods (NOM = 0, NOPM = 0) and WMC = 0 indicates a large, data‑heavy unit with little or no behavioral decomposition. The lack of methods and behavioral complexity alongside high field count signals multiple responsibilities or data groups that could be split into smaller classes. LCOM = -1.0 (low/unknown cohesion) and zero fanin/fanout (0/0) further suggest internal complexity not organized into cohesive submodules. These metric elements justify flagging insufficient modularization."
