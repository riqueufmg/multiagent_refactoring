    "justification": "Class is very small and simple: LOC=6, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOF=1. It has no methods, zero complexity, no inheritance depth (DIT=0), no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate a minimal single-responsibility entity rather than a class that needs further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
