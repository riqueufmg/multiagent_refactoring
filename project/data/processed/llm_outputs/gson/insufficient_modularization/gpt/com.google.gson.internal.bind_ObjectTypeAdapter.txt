    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.ObjectTypeAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High implementation size and complexity indicate insufficient decomposition: LOC=119 and WMC=28 (high cyclomatic complexity) for a single class with nom=8 methods (nopm=4 public) suggests heavy internal logic. The class depends on multiple distinct concerns (JsonReader, JsonWriter, JsonToken, TypeAdapterFactory, TypeAdapter, ToNumberStrategy/ToNumberPolicy, TypeToken, Gson), implying it handles parsing, writing, type adaptation and number strategy responsibilities. DIT=1 and nc=0 mean no inheritance/nesting to distribute behavior, so further modularization (extracting responsibilities into helper classes/adapters) would likely reduce size and complexity. LCOM=0.0 shows cohesion but does not offset the high WMC/LOC and multi-concern dependency profile, so the class is a candidate for decomposition."
