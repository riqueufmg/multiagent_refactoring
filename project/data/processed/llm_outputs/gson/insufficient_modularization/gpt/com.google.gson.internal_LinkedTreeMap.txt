    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.LinkedTreeMap",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Considered in isolation, the class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (LOC = 504) and high implementation complexity (WMC = 58); many state and behavior elements (21 fields, 24 methods of which 12 are public) indicating multiple responsibilities and a large public surface; presence of multiple nested/internal types (com.google.gson.internal.LinkedTreeMap.Node, KeySet, EntrySet) that suggest distinct concerns that could be extracted; LCOM = 0.25 (moderate cohesion) does not offset the class's size and complexity. These elements together justify decomposing the class to reduce size and complexity."
