    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag.OuterMessage",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Large class size and concentrated data: loc=630 and nof=18 (nopf=4) indicate substantial implementation in a single class; nom=0 and wmc=0 show there are no distributed behaviors/method breakdown to reduce class size; lcom=-1.0 indicates cohesion cannot be shown to be high. Together these metrics suggest the class bundles too much (multiple responsibilities/data) and would benefit from further decomposition (insufficient modularization)."
