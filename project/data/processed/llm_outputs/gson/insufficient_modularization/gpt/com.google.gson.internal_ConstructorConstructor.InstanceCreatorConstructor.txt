    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No smell: class is very small and low-complexity (LOC=11, nof=2, nom=0, wmc=0), with minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (dit=1). These metrics show the class is already small and simple, so there is no evidence it needs further decomposition (no insufficient modularization)."
