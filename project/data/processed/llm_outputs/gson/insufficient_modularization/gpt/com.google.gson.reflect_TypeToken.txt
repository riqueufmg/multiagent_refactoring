    "class": "com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class exhibits characteristics of Insufficient Modularization: large size (loc = 285), high implementation complexity (wmc = 64), many methods (nom = 22, of which nopm = 12 are public) and a small number of fields (nof = 3) which suggests a large behaviour surface. Depth of inheritance is 0 (dit = 0) and fanin/fanout are 0, indicating decomposition has not been achieved via subclassing or clear external delegation. Although cohesion is not extremely poor (lcom = 0.1818), the combination of high LOC, high WMC and large public API surface supports that the class can be further decomposed to reduce size and complexity."
