    "justification": "Class has only 1 method (nom=1), 0 fields (nof=0), small size (loc=15) and very low complexity (wmc=1). It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), DIT=0 and LCOM=-1.0 indicating high cohesion. Given the small size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence this class is insufficiently modularized and no further decomposition is warranted."
