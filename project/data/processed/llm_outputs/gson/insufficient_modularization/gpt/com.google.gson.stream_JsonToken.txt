    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class: LOC=36, NOM=0, WMC=0, NC=0, DIT=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0, dependencies=[]. There are no methods or internal complexity to decompose and no coupling or size indicators that suggest further modularization would reduce size or complexity. LCOM=-1.0 indicates lack of applicable cohesion data. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
