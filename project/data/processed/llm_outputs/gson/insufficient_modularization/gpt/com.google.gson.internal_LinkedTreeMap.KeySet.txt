    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=22, nom=0, nof=0, wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. There are no methods or fields to decompose and complexity is zero, so there is no evidence of an undivided, overly large or complex class. LCOM=-1 (not applicable) further suggests no cohesion data indicating a decomposition need. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
