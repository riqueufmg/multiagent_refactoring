    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=27, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=2. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its low size, low complexity and high cohesion, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition (no insufficient modularization)."
