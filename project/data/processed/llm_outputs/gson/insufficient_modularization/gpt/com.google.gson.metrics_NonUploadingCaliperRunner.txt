    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC=18), few methods (nom=3, nopm=1), low complexity (WMC=4), high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0), and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These values suggest the class is already small and cohesive and does not require further decomposition."
