    "class": "com.example.NoSerializedNameMain.TestClassNoArgsConstructor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and trivial: LOC=3, 1 field (nof=1, nopf=1), 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), WMC=0, no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate low size and complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has not been decomposed further or would benefit from additional modularization."
