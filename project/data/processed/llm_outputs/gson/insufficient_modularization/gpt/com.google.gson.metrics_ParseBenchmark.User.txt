    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.ParseBenchmark.User",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: number of fields NOF=36 (very high) while number of methods NOM=0 and WMC=0, indicating it contains many data members with no behavior. LOC=38 with 36 fields implies the class aggregates many fields in a small file (data clump) and is a likely candidate for decomposition. LCOM=-1.0 (cohesion measure) combined with the field/method imbalance and fanin=0/fanout=0 (isolated) support the conclusion that the class should be split into smaller, more focused classes."
