    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=10), no methods (nom=0), no fields (nof=0), no complexity (wmc=0), no inheritance depth (dit=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and no external dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
