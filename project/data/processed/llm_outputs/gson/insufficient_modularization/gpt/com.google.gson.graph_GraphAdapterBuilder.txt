    "class": "com.google.gson.graph.GraphAdapterBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being too large and insufficiently decomposed: large size (loc=228) combined with relatively few methods (nom=5, nopm=5) implies long methods and concentrated responsibilities; many fields (nof=11) indicate substantial internal state that could be partitioned; moderate cohesion (lcom=0.4) suggests multiple responsibilities rather than a single cohesive role; presence of inner/nested responsibilities in dependencies (com.google.gson.graph.GraphAdapterBuilder.Element, com.google.gson.graph.GraphAdapterBuilder.Factory) points to logical subcomponents already present that could be extracted into separate classes; WMC=7 with high LOC further supports that complexity is implemented in large methods rather than distributed. These factors together justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
