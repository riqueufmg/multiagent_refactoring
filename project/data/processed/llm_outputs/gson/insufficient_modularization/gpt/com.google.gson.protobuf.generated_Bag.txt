    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows clear signs of Insufficient Modularization: extremely large size (loc = 6101) combined with a very high number of fields (nof = 151, nopf = 28) while exposing very few methods (nom = 4, nopm = 3). Cohesion metric is poor (lcom = 0.75), indicating relatedness among members is low. The class also contains many nested/related types (ProtoWithRepeatedFields, ProtoWithAnnotationsAndJsonNames, ProtoWithDifferentCaseFormat, Annotations, SimpleProto, ProtoWithAnnotations, InnerMessage, Type, Data, OuterMessage), suggesting distinct responsibilities bundled into one unit. Low behavioral complexity per method (wmc = 4) plus the large data footprint implies the class is primarily a large data holder that would benefit from decomposition into smaller, more cohesive classes."
