    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.reflect.ReflectionHelper",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: it has a high method count (nom = 16) with many public methods (nopm = 12), moderate size (loc = 218) and elevated complexity (wmc = 23), indicating multiple responsibilities and implementation complexity. The cohesion measure (lcom = 0.375) is not high, suggesting related behavior is spread across methods rather than tightly focused. The presence of an internal helper type (ReflectionHelper.RecordHelper) further indicates internal sub-responsibilities that could be separated. Together these metrics justify decomposing the class into smaller, more focused modules."
