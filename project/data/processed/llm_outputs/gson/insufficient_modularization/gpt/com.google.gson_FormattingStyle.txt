    "justification": "Class examined in isolation does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: size and complexity are modest (LOC=83, WMC=9), method count is small (NOM=7, public methods ~6), field count is moderate (NOF=5, NOPF=2), and cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). There is no inheritance depth (DIT=0) and no measured coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate a cohesive, low-complexity class that does not require further decomposition."
