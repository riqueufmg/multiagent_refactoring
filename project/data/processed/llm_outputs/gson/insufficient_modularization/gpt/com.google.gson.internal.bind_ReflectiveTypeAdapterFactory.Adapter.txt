    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory.Adapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an undecomposed, complex class: LOC is moderate (68) but the class has no methods (nom=0) and zero weighted method complexity (wmc=0), only one field (nof=1), no fan-in/fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0), and shallow inheritance (dit=1). The available cohesion metric is invalid/negative (lcom=-1.0) and there is only a single external dependency (com.google.gson.stream.JsonToken). Given the lack of methods, complexity, and coupling in the provided data, there is insufficient evidence to classify this class as suffering from Insufficient Modularization."
