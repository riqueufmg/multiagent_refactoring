    "class": "com.google.gson.ReflectionAccessFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization. Metrics show a small size (loc=84) and moderate complexity (wmc=9) with a modest number of methods (nom=9) and fields (nof=4). Cohesion is high (lcom=-1.0) and coupling is low (fanout=0, fanin=0). It has only a couple of external dependencies (com.google.gson.ReflectionAccessFilter.FilterResult, com.google.gson.internal.ReflectionAccessFilterHelper). These elements indicate the class is cohesive and not overly large or complex, so further decomposition is not justified based on the provided data."
