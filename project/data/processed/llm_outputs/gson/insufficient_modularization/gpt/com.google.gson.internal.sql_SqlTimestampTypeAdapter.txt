    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=25, WMC=5, NOM=4 (NOPM=3) and NOF=2 indicate limited size and complexity. LCOM=0.5 shows acceptable cohesion. DIT=1 and fanin=0/fanout=0 show trivial inheritance and low coupling to decompose. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class has excessive size or complexity that would benefit from further decomposition."
