    "class": "com.example.ClassWithNoArgsConstructor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=9, single field (nof=1) and single method (nom=1), low complexity (WMC=1), very low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), high cohesion (LCOM=0.0) and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not show signs of insufficient modularization."
