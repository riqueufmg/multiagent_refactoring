    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is very small and not complex: loc=6, nom=0 (no methods), nof=1 (one field), wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0. With no methods, minimal state, zero complexity and no coupling, there is no evidence this class has insufficient modularization or would benefit from further decomposition when analyzed in isolation."
