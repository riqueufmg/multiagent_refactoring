    "justification": "Class is small and has minimal responsibility: LOC=22, no methods (nom=0, nopm=0), low complexity (wmc=0), only 2 fields (nof=2). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0, no dependencies). Given its small size, absence of behavior, and low complexity/coupling, there is no evidence it requires further decomposition."
