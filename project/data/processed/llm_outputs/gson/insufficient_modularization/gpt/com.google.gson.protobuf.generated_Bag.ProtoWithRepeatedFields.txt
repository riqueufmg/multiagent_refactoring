    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Detected due to very large implementation size and many fields in a single class: LOC=876 and NOF=16 (with 3 public fields). The class has no methods recorded (NOM=0) yet occupies high LOC, indicating a monolithic data/implementation block that has not been decomposed. Low cohesion signal (LCOM=-1.0) and absence of external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) reinforce that responsibilities are concentrated in this class; it should be split into smaller, more cohesive classes or components."
