    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: 34 LOC, 2 fields (nof=2), 1 method (nom=1), and low complexity (WMC=2). LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. There are no children (nc=0) and no external coupling indicated by fanout=0/fanin=0. Given the minimal size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that further decomposition is necessary."
