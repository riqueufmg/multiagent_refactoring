    "justification": "Insufficient Modularization detected based on the class metrics and dependencies: LOC=117 and WMC=29 indicate substantial size and high implementation complexity; NOM=5 with only NOPM=2 and NOF=1 shows a small number of methods/fields but high per-method complexity (complex methods likely doing multiple tasks); LCOM=0.6 suggests only moderate cohesion (methods are not tightly focused); the class depends on multiple distinct concerns (JsonReader, JsonWriter, JsonToken, JsonElement, JsonPrimitive, JsonNull) implying it handles both read/write streaming and multiple JSON element types. Together these elements indicate the class is doing multiple responsibilities and would benefit from further decomposition."
