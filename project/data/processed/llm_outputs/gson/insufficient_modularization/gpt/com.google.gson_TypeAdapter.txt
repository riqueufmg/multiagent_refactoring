    "class": "com.google.gson.TypeAdapter",

    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-decomposed class: method count (nom = 10) is small, size (loc = 122) is moderate, and complexity (wmc = 11) is low-to-moderate. There is no inheritance depth (dit = 0) and cohesion metric is unavailable (lcom = -1.0) so there is no evidence of poor cohesion. Dependency list is limited (7 collaborators) and fanin/fanout are reported as 0 in the provided snapshot. Based on these values considered in isolation, the class does not exhibit clear signs of Insufficient Modularization."
