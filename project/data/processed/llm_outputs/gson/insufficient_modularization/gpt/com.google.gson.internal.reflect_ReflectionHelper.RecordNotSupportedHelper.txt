    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.reflect.ReflectionHelper.RecordNotSupportedHelper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: very small size (loc=17), no methods or fields reported (nom=0, nopf=0, nopm=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 with no members suggests no internal complexity to decompose. Based on these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
