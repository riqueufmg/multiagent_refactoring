    "class": "com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class appears monolithic and a candidate for further decomposition: very large size (loc = 1244), very high complexity (wmc = 329), many fields (nof = 45) and many methods (nom = 46, nopm = 26). It exists as a single class unit (nc = 1) with no inheritance depth (dit = 0), indicating functionality has not been split across subclasses or collaborators. fanin and fanout are 0, suggesting the class implements much behavior internally rather than delegating. Although cohesion metric (lcom = 0.0) does not indicate fragmentation, the combination of high LOC, high WMC, and large counts of fields/methods supports the conclusion that the class has insufficient modularization and would likely benefit from decomposition into smaller, focused classes or modules."
