    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag.ProtoWithAnnotations",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High size and many fields indicate insufficient modularization: loc=2361, nof=58 (nopf=13) while having no methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity metrics (wmc=0). The combination of very large LOC and large number of fields with no method decomposition suggests the class has not been sufficiently decomposed and would benefit from further modularization."
