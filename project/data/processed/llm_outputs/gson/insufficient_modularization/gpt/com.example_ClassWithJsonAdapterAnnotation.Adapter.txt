    "justification": "Class is very small and non-complex: LOC = 8, number of methods (nom) = 0, number of fields (nof) = 0, WMC = 0, fanin = 0, fanout = 0, and no dependencies. These metrics indicate there is no sizable implementation or complexity to decompose further (DIT = 1 and LCOM value are not meaningful given the absence of members). Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
