    "justification": "Class shows no sign of insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=11), no methods reported (nom=0) and zero complexity (wmc=0), low inheritance depth (dit=1), cohesion metric not indicating fragmentation (lcom=-1.0), and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and does not require further decomposition."
