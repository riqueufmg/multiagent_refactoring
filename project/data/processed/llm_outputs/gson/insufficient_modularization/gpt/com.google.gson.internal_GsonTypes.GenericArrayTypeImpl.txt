    "justification": "The class is small and low complexity: loc=20, nof=2 (only two fields), nom=0 and nopm=0 (no methods), wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0 and no dependencies. With no methods and minimal state there is no internal implementation complexity or size indicating a need for further decomposition. The LCOM value (-1.0) does not indicate a cohesion problem that would motivate splitting. Therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
