    "justification": "Class is small and already cohesive: 43 LOC, 1 method, 2 fields, WMC 4 and LCOM 0.0 indicate low implementation complexity and high cohesion; DIT 1 and fanin/fanout 0 show low coupling. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or that it requires further decomposition."
