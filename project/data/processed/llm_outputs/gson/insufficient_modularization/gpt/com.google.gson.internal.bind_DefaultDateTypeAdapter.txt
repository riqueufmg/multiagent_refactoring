    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a clear need for decomposition: loc=115 and nom=8 show only moderate size and method count; wmc=15 is borderline but not extreme; nof=6 and nopm=5 are modest. Cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.375), inheritance depth is minimal (dit=1), and there is no coupling pressure in the provided data (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these values, the class appears reasonably cohesive and not excessively complex in isolation, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
