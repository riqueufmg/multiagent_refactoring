    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=16, nof=1, nom=0, wmc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0, and only one dependency (com.google.gson.internal.ObjectConstructor). There are no methods or significant complexity or coupling that suggest multiple responsibilities or size that would benefit from further decomposition. Based on these elements considered in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
