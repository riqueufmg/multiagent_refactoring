    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=40, WMC=0, NOM=0 (no methods) and NOF=4 (few fields). Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 indicate low coupling and limited external interaction (only two listed dependencies). These metrics suggest a simple data-holder with no sizable implementation to decompose, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
