    "justification": "The class is small and not complex: LOC=20, number of methods (nom)=2, WMC=2. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and it has only one dependency (com.google.gson.JsonElement). There is no indication of large size, high complexity, or multiple unrelated responsibilities (LCOM=-1.0). Based on these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
