    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: number of methods (nom) = 0, weighted method complexity (wmc) = 0, fan-in = 0, fan-out = 0, and a modest size (loc = 55) with 4 fields (nof = 4). There is no evidence of high complexity, many responsibilities, or large method count that would suggest further decomposition is needed when the class is considered in isolation."
