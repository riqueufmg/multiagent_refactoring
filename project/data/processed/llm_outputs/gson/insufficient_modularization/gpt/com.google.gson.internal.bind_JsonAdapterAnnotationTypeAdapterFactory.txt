    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonAdapterAnnotationTypeAdapterFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit strong signs of Insufficient Modularization: although its LOC is 109, it has a modest number of methods (nom=7) and public methods (nopm=3), a moderate cyclomatic complexity (wmc=18), and only 4 fields (nof=4). Its LCOM=0.0 indicates good cohesion and DIT=1 indicates a simple inheritance level. These metrics suggest the class is reasonably cohesive and of moderate size/complexity and does not require further decomposition in isolation."
