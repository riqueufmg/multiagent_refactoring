    "class": "com.example.NoSerializedNameMain",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows small size and low complexity (LOC=41, WMC=4, NOM=4, NOF=3, NOPM=3). Cohesion is moderate (LCOM=0.5) but not high enough to indicate clear decomposition need. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, so the class is not highly coupled to other modules. Although there are nested/dependent inner classes listed, the overall metrics do not indicate a class that is overly large or complex and therefore do not justify 'Insufficient Modularization'."
