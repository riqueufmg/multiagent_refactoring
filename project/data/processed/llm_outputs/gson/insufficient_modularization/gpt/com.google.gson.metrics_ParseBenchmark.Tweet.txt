    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class declares a large number of fields (nof = 20) while having very few lines of code (loc = 22) and no methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0). This combination indicates the class is a large data holder with many responsibilities packed into one type and little behavior, suggesting it has not been sufficiently decomposed. The absence of methods (nom = 0) and zero coupling indicators (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) further imply internal grouping of data rather than separated, cohesive components. These elements justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
