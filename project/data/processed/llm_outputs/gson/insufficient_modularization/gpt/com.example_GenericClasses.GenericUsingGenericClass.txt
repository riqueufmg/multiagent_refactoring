    "justification": "Class is very small and not complex: LOC=6, WMC=0, NOM=0 (no methods), NOF=1 (single field). Coupling is nil (fanin=0, fanout=0). LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate cohesion problems in the provided data. Given the minimal size and lack of implementation complexity or multiple responsibilities, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
