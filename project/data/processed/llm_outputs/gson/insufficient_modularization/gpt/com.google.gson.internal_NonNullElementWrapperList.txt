    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: the class is small (loc=63) with a single field (nof=1) and many small methods (nom=18) resulting in high cohesion (lcom=0.0). Although WMC is moderate (wmc=19), the low LOC and LCOM suggest the methods are related and the class is not a large, monolithic unit that should be decomposed. Fan-in and fan-out are 0, indicating no external coupling that would drive splitting. Therefore, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
