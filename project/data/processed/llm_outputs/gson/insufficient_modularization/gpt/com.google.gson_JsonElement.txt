    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonElement",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is relatively large and complex (nom=23 methods, loc=227, wmc=27), indicating many responsibilities implemented in one place. It depends on multiple distinct element types and I/O/utility concerns (dependencies: com.google.gson.JsonPrimitive, com.google.gson.JsonArray, com.google.gson.JsonObject, com.google.gson.JsonNull, com.google.gson.stream.JsonWriter, com.google.gson.internal.Streams, com.google.gson.Strictness), which suggests mixed responsibilities (type handling, serialization, utilities). The cohesion metric is problematic (lcom=-1.0) and there is no inheritance decomposition (dit=0), so further decomposition into smaller, focused classes or helper components could reduce size and implementation complexity."
