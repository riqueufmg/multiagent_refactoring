    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: loc=9, wmc=1, nom=1, nof=1, nopm=1. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shows high cohesion (lcom=0.0). Given the low size, low complexity and single responsibility, there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
