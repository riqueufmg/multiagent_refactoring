    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=35, NOM=3, WMC=5 (low complexity). LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. Coupling is minimal (fanout=0, dependencies limited to JsonElement and JsonNull). Given its small size, low complexity, few responsibilities and low coupling, there is no evidence that it needs further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
