    "justification": "Class is very small and self-contained: LOC=11, no methods (nom=0), only two fields (nof=2), zero complexity (wmc=0), no inheritance depth (dit=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). These metrics indicate no evidence that the class is large or complex enough to require further decomposition (LCOM=-1.0 does not indicate a cohesion problem in this data)."
