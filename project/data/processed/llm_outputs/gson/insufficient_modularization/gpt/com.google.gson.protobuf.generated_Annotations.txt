    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=36, WMC=4, NOM=4, NOPM=3. Although LCOM=0.75 suggests moderate-low cohesion and NOF=5 shows several fields, the overall size and complexity are low, so there is no strong evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity. Dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) are absent, reinforcing that the class is isolated and currently simple enough to not require modularization."
