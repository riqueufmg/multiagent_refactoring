    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive: LOC=56, number of methods (nom)=2, weighted methods per class (wmc)=3, LCOM=0.0 (high cohesion). Field count (nof)=3 with no non-private fields (nopf=0) indicates encapsulation. Inheritance depth (dit)=1 and zero incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) show low complexity and limited responsibilities. Based on these metrics the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization (no large size, high complexity, or poor cohesion)."
