    "justification": "No smell detected: the class is small and contains no decomposable behavior. Metrics show LOC=28, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPF=0, WMC=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0 and LCOM=-1.0 (not indicating cohesive method clustering). With zero methods/fields and zero complexity/coupling, there is no evidence that further decomposition is needed."
