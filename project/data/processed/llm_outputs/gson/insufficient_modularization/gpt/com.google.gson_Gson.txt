    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc = 826) and high implementation complexity (WMC = 104) combined with many methods (nom = 51, public methods nopm = 43) indicate multiple responsibilities that could be split. Cohesion is moderate/low (LCOM = 0.431), suggesting the methods are not tightly focused. The class also depends on a large set of external components (31 listed dependencies), implying it coordinates many concerns. Together these metrics justify that further decomposition would likely reduce size and complexity."
