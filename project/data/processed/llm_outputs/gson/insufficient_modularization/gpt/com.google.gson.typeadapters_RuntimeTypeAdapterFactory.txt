    "class": "com.google.gson.typeadapters.RuntimeTypeAdapterFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large implementation size (LOC = 129) and high complexity (WMC = 30). It exposes many behaviors (nom = 10 methods, nopm = 9 public methods) and holds multiple fields (nof = 6), while depending on multiple Gson concerns (TypeToken, JsonWriter, JsonReader, JsonElement, JsonObject, Gson, TypeAdapter). These characteristics indicate the class likely bundles multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity. (Note: LCOM = 0.0 shows cohesion is not low, but the high LOC/WMC and number of public methods still justify decomposition.)"
