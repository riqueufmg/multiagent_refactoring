    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.TypeAdapterRuntimeTypeWrapper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows small size and reasonable modularity: LOC=53, number of methods=5, number of fields=3. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). Overall complexity is moderate (WMC=11) but not large enough, and the class has a small public surface (public methods=2). These metrics indicate the class is already compact and cohesive, so there is no strong evidence of insufficient modularization."
