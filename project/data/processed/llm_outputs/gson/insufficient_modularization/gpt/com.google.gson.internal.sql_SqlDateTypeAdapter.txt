    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an unduly large or complex class that needs further decomposition: LOC=45 (small), NOM=4 with NOPM=3 (few methods), WMC=6 (moderate complexity), NOF=2 (few fields). Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 show limited external coupling. Although LCOM=0.75 suggests some cohesion concerns, the overall size and method/complexity counts are low, so there is insufficient evidence that the class is insufficiently modular and would benefit from decomposition."
