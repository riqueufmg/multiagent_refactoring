    "justification": "Class is small and cohesive enough to not require further decomposition: LOC=25, NOM=4 (NOPM=2) indicates few methods, WMC=6 indicates low-to-moderate complexity, NOF=1 and no public fields, LCOM=0.5 does not show severe lack of cohesion, and FANIN=0/FANOUT=0 show no coupling pressures. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no clear evidence of insufficient modularization."
