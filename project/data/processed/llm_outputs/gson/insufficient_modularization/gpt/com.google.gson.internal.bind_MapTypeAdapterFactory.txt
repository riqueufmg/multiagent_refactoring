    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.MapTypeAdapterFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: The class has low implementation complexity (WMC=4) and a small number of methods (NOM=3, public methods=2). Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0). Inheritance depth is minimal (DIT=1) and there are only 5 fields. Although LOC=147 and there are multiple external dependencies, the low complexity and high cohesion indicate the class is not a large, monolithic unit that clearly requires further decomposition."
