    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modular: large size (loc = 503), high implementation complexity (wmc = 81), many methods (nom = 39) including a large public API (nopm = 28), and a substantial number of fields (nof = 14). These characteristics indicate multiple responsibilities and a concentrated amount of behavior and state that could be separated into smaller, focused classes to reduce size and complexity and improve maintainability."
