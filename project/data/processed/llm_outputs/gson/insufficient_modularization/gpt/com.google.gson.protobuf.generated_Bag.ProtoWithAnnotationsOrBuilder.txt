    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class has no methods and no fields (nom=0, nof=0), no implementation complexity (wmc=0), no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and small size (loc=59). LCOM is -1.0 (not applicable). Given the absence of internal behavior or size/complexity to decompose, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization when the class is considered in isolation."
