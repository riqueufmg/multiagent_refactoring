        "Class is small and simple: loc=29, nof=2 fields, nom=0 methods — there is no internal method complexity to decompose.",
        "Low implementation complexity: wmc=0 and nc=0 indicate no weighted method complexity or nested constructs requiring decomposition.",
        "Low coupling and shallow hierarchy: fanout=0, fanin=0 and dit=1 imply minimal dependencies and inheritance depth, reducing need for modularization.",
        "High cohesion indicator: lcom=-1.0 (cohesive) and single dependency on com.google.gson.TypeAdapter suggest the class is focused and not a candidate for further decomposition."
