    "class": "com.example.InterfaceWithImplementation.Implementation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and low-complexity: loc=8, nom=0 (no methods), nof=1 (one field), wmc=0, nc=0, dit=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion metric does not indicate internal complexity (lcom=-1.0). Given the lack of methods, low LOC and zero complexity, there is no evidence that the class has insufficient modularization or that it should be further decomposed."
