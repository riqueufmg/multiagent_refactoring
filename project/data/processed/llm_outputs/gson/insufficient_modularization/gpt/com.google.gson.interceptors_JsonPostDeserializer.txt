    "justification": "The class is very small and simple (loc=10) with a single method (nom=1, nopm=1), no fields (nof=0), and minimal complexity (wmc=1). Coupling is nil (fanin=0, fanout=0) and cohesion measure is not indicating fragmentation (lcom=-1.0). Given its tiny size, single responsibility and low complexity, there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
