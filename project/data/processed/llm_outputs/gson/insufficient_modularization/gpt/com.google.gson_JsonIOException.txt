    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=21, NOM=3, NOF=1, WMC=3. Cohesion LCOM=1.0 with only three methods is not indicative of a large undecomposed class. Shallow inheritance (DIT=1), zero incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies indicate the class is self-contained. Given these metrics, there is no evidence that further decomposition is required."
