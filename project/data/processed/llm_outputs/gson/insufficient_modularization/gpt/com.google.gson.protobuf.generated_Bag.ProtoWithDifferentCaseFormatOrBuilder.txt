    "justification": "Class has low size and complexity: LOC=39, NOM=0, NOF=0, WMC=0. Coupling is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0). There are no methods or fields to decompose, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization. (LCOM=-1.0 appears to be an invalid/placeholder value and does not indicate a cohesion problem.)"
