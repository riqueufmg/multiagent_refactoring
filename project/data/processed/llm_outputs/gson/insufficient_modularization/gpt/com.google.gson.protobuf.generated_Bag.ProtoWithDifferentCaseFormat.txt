    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag.ProtoWithDifferentCaseFormat",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very high size (loc = 571) while having no methods (nom = 0) and a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 12, nopf = 2). The large LOC combined with zero methods and WMC = 0 indicates the class is monolithic (lots of code/data without decomposed behavior), suggesting it could be split into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
