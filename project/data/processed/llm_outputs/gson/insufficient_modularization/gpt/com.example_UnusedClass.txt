    "justification": "Class is very small and already minimal: LOC=8, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=1. LCOM=0.0 indicates high cohesion. Fan-in=0 and Fan-out=0 and no dependencies show it has no coupling that suggests hidden responsibilities. Given its low size and complexity, there is no evidence that it must be further decomposed, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
