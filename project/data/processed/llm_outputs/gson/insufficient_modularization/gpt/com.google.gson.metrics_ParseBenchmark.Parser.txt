    "justification": "Class has extremely small size and no internal complexity: LOC=3, NOF=0, NOM=0, WMC=0, NC=0. There are no fields or methods to decompose (nopf=0, nopm=0) and no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics, there is no evidence of a large or complex class that would benefit from further decomposition; thus Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
