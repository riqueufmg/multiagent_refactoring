    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc=454) combined with a high number of methods (nom=35) and a very large public API surface (nopm=31) indicate substantial implementation contained in a single class. Complexity is also elevated (wmc=52) and the class declares many fields (nof=20), which together suggest multiple responsibilities or many configuration paths that could be split out. The dependency list is long and varied, implying the class coordinates many concerns. Although LCOM is low (0.057), indicating cohesion, the absolute size, public surface, field count, and complexity justify further decomposition to reduce class size and implementation complexity."
