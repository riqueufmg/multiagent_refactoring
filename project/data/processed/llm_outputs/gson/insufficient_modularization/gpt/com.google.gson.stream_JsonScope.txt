    "class": "com.google.gson.stream.JsonScope",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class shows no signs of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=41), very low complexity (wmc=1), only one method (nom=1), high cohesion (lcom=0.0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although it has 8 fields (nof=8), the overall metrics indicate the class is small and simple, so there is no evidence it needs further decomposition."
