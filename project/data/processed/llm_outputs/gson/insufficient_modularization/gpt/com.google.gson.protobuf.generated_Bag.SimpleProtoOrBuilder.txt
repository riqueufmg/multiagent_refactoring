    "justification": "Metrics show the class is very small and low-complexity: loc=27, nof=0, nom=0, wmc=0, nopm=0, nc=0, dit=0, lcom=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0, and there are no dependencies. These values indicate no internal size or complexity that would benefit from further decomposition, so there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
