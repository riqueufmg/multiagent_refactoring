    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=9, number of methods (nom)=1, WMC=1 indicating minimal complexity. It has no fields (nof=0), high cohesion (LCOM=-1.0), and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given its size and simplicity, there is no evidence that it has not been decomposed further or that decomposition would reduce size/complexity; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
