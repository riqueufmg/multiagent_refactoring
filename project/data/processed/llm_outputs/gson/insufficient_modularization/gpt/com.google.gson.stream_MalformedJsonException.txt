    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=15, WMC=3, NOM=3 (likely constructors), NOF=1. There are no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0). Although LCOM=1.0 indicates low measured cohesion, for a tiny exception class decomposition would not reduce size or complexity. Given the very low complexity and size, further modularization is not justified."
