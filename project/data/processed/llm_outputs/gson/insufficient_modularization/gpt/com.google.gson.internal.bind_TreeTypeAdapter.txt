    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.TreeTypeAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Size and complexity: LOC=117 and WMC=14 indicate a moderately large and complex class. Structural imbalance: 13 fields vs. 9 methods (high fields-to-methods ratio) and 8 public methods suggest it holds state and multiple responsibilities. Cohesion: LCOM=0.333 (only moderate cohesion) implies the class is not highly focused. Dependencies: the class interacts with many distinct types (com.google.gson.JsonDeserializer, com.google.gson.JsonSerializer, com.google.gson.TypeAdapter, com.google.gson.Gson, com.google.gson.JsonElement, Streams, JsonReader/JsonWriter, TypeToken, TypeAdapterFactory, and an inner GsonContextImpl), indicating it handles both serialization and deserialization concerns plus contextual behavior. Taken together, these elements point to insufficient modularization and an opportunity to decompose the class to reduce size and complexity."
