{
    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.BagOfPrimitives",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC=48), modest complexity (WMC=9), limited surface (5 fields, 7 methods), and good cohesion (LCOM=0.2857). Additionally it has no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no deep inheritance (DIT=0). These metrics do not indicate the class is too large or complex and thus do not justify further decomposition."
