    "justification": "Not detected: the class is very small and contains no behavior to decompose (loc=7, nom=0, nopm=0), only two fields (nof=2) with no public fields (nopf=0). Complexity and size indicators are minimal (wmc=0), cohesion measure is not applicable for no-method class (lcom=-1.0), and coupling is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not indicate a need for further decomposition."
