    "justification": "Metrics indicate no need for further decomposition: nom=0 (no methods), nof=0 (no fields), wmc=0 (no complexity), loc=42 (small size), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), single dependency on com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag. Given the class has no members and low complexity when considered in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
