    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.Excluder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Based on the provided isolated metrics, this class does not exhibit clear Insufficient Modularization. Evidence: high cohesion (LCOM = 0.0) indicating related responsibilities; moderate size (LOC = 162) with a modest number of methods (nom = 16, public methods = 10) and fields (nof = 9); shallow inheritance (DIT = 1). Although complexity measure is elevated (WMC = 42), the combination of strong cohesion and a limited public API suggests the class is not obviously under-modularized from the given data; the WMC alone is not sufficient to justify decomposition in isolation."
