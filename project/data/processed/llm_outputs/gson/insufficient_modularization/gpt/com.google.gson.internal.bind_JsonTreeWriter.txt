    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonTreeWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: high number of methods (nom = 23, nopm = 21) and a large implementation size (loc = 179) indicate a broad surface and substantial internal code. High complexity (wmc = 42) suggests multiple complex behaviors that could be split. The class depends on multiple JSON types (JsonPrimitive, JsonArray, JsonElement, JsonObject, JsonNull) indicating it handles several distinct concerns (primitives, arrays, objects, nulls) that are candidates for decomposition. A small field set (nof = 5) combined with many methods implies operations are not tightly bound to a small state, increasing the chance of multiple responsibilities. Given these metrics and dependencies (considering the class in isolation), refactoring into smaller focused classes or helpers is warranted."
