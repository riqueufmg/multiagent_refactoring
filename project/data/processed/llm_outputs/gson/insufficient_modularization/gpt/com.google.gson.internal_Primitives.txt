    "justification": "WMC = 23 with NOM = 5: high overall complexity concentrated in a small number of methods (average complexity ~4.6 per method) indicating methods are relatively complex and the class likely mixes responsibilities; LOC = 51: moderate size that, combined with high complexity, suggests decomposition could reduce implementation complexity; NOPM = 4 (many public methods): the class exposes multiple entry points, which can be a sign of multiple responsibilities that could be split; fanin = 0 and fanout = 0: the class is isolated in the provided data, so decomposing it would not (in this isolated analysis) create additional coupling. These elements together justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
