    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and low-complexity: loc=24, nom=2, wmc=2, nof=0, nopm=0. Coupling and dependency indicators show no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). Inheritance depth is minimal (dit=0) and reported cohesion is not indicating fragmentation (lcom=-1.0). Given the small size, low complexity, and lack of multiple fields or dependencies, there is no evidence in isolation that this class requires further decomposition."
