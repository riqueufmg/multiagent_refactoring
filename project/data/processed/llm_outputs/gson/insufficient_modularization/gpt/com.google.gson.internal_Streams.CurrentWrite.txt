    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: LOC=26, number of methods (nom)=0, weighted methods complexity (wmc)=0, number of fields (nof)=2. Coupling is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no class-level complexity or cohesion concerns are reported (nc=0, lcom=-1.0). Given its small size, lack of methods and low complexity, there is no evidence the class has insufficient modularization or requires further decomposition."
