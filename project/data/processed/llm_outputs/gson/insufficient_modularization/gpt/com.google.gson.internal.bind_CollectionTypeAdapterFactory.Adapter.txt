    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.CollectionTypeAdapterFactory.Adapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: it is small (loc=33), has very low implementation complexity (wmc=0), very few members (nof=2, nom=0, nopm=0), shallow inheritance (dit=1), and high cohesion indicator (lcom=-1.0). Coupling appears limited (fanin=0, fanout=0, only 3 external dependencies listed). Given the low size and complexity metrics, further decomposition is not warranted."
