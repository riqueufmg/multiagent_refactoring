    "justification": "Class has very small size and complexity: loc=6, wmc=0, nom=0 (no methods), nof=1 (one field). It has no coupling to or from other code (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no dependencies. With no methods to decompose and minimal LOC, there is no evidence that further decomposition would reduce size or complexity."
