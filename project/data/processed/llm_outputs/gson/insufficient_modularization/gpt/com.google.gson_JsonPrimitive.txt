    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonPrimitive",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High complexity and size indicate insufficient modularization: WMC=40 (high cyclomatic complexity), NOM=23 methods and NOPM=22 public methods (large API surface), LOC=215 (substantial class size). Although LCOM=0.086 suggests good cohesion, the combination of many methods and high complexity (with only DIT=1) implies multiple responsibilities or dense conditional/behavioral logic that could be decomposed (e.g., numeric handling indicated by dependency com.google.gson.internal.NumberLimits). These elements justify that the class can be further modularized to reduce size and implementation complexity."
