    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.JsonReaderInternalAccess",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=10, 1 field, 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), WMC=1 indicating minimal complexity. Cohesion is maximal (LCOM=0.0) and there is minimal coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, single dependency on com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader). Given its small size, low complexity, and high cohesion, there is no evidence that it needs further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
