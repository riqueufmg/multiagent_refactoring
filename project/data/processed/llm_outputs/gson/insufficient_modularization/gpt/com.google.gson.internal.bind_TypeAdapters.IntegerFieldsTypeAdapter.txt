    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=44), no methods (nom=0), single field (nof=1), very low complexity (wmc=0), minimal coupling (fanout=0, dependencies include only com.google.gson.stream.JsonToken). There is no evidence of a large, complex class or multiple responsibilities that would suggest it needs further decomposition when considered in isolation."
