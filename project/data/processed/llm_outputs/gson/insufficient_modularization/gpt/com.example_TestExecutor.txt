    "class": "com.example.TestExecutor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class does not exhibit insufficient modularization: small size (loc=23), low number of methods (nom=3) and low complexity (wmc=3), high cohesion (lcom=-1.0), no fields (nof=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and a small public API (nopm=2). These metrics indicate the class is small, cohesive and simple, so further decomposition is not warranted."
