    "detection": true,
    "justification": "LCOM=1.0 indicates very low cohesion; the class holds nof=6 fields but only nom=3 methods (high field-to-method ratio) and nopf=6 with nopm=0 (fields exposed while no public methods), suggesting it aggregates state/roles rather than a single cohesive responsibility. It also depends on multiple distinct adapters (SqlDateTypeAdapter, SqlTimestampTypeAdapter, SqlTimeTypeAdapter, TypeAdapterFactory), implying multiple responsibilities that could be split. Despite a modest size (loc=51, wmc=3), these metrics together point to insufficient modularization and candidate decomposition."
