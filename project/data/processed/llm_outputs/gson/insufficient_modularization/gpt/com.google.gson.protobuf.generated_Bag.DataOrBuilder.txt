    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate a class that requires further decomposition: loc=37 (small size), nom=0 and nopf=0 (no methods to decompose), wmc=0 (no complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling suggesting hidden responsibilities), nc=0 and dit=0. No dependencies listed. These elements show the class is small and contains no implementation complexity or multiple responsibilities, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
