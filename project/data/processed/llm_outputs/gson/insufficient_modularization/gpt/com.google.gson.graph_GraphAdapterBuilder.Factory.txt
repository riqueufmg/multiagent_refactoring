    "justification": "The class does not show indicators of insufficient modularization: number of methods is 0 (nom: 0, nopm: 0) and weighted method complexity is 0 (wmc: 0), so there is no behavioral complexity to decompose; only 2 fields (nof: 2) and moderate size (loc: 112) but no methods suggests no large cohesive implementation body to split; cohesion is high (lcom: -1.0); coupling is low (fanin: 0, fanout: 0) and inheritance depth is shallow (dit: 1). These metrics do not support further decomposition in isolation."
