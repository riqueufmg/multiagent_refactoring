    "justification": "Class is very small and not complex: LOC = 14, WMC = 0, NOM = 0, NOF = 0, NOPF = 0, NOPM = 0. It has no methods/fields reported, LCOM = -1.0, DIT = 1, FANIN = 0, FANOUT = 0, and no dependencies. These metrics indicate minimal size and complexity, so there is no evidence that the class has not been sufficiently decomposed or would benefit from further modularization."
