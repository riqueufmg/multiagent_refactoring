    "justification": "Class is small and already cohesive: LOC=39, WMC=1, NOM=1 indicate low size and low complexity. LCOM=0.0 shows high cohesion despite NOF=4. FANIN=0 and FANOUT=0 show no coupling pressure. Dependencies list inner classes (GenericClass, DummyClass), indicating decomposition is present. Taken in isolation, these metrics do not justify further modularization."
