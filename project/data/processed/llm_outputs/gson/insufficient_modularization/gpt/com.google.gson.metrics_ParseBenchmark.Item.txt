    "justification": "The class is small and non-complex: LOC=13, WMC=0, NOM=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. Although it has 8 fields (NOF=8), it contains no methods or measurable complexity, and coupling is nil. These metrics indicate a simple data holder rather than an under-decomposed, large/complex class, so there is insufficient evidence to flag Insufficient Modularization. (LCOM=-1.0 is inconclusive and does not override the low size/complexity indicators.)"
