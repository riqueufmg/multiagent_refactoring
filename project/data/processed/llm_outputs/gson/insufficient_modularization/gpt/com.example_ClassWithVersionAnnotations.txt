    "justification": "Class shows no signs of being insufficiently modular: very small size (loc=9), no methods (nom=0) and low complexity (wmc=0), only 4 fields (nof=4) and no public fields (nopf=0). Coupling is absent (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). LCOM=-1.0 indicates cohesion metric not applicable or trivial for this class. Given these metrics in isolation, there is no evidence that the class should be further decomposed."
