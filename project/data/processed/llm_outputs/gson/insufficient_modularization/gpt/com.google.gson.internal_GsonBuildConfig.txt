    "justification": "Class is minimal and does not present insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=12), only 1 field (nof=1) and 1 method (nom=1), low complexity (wmc=1), high cohesion (lcom=0.0), zero inheritance depth (dit=0), and no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not require further modularization."
