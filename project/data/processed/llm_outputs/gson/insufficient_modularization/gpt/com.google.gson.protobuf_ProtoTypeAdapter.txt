    "justification": "Detected. Evidence: large size and complexity (loc=243, wmc=32) indicating a heavy class; many fields (nof=14) while having a relatively small number of methods (nom=9) and few public methods (nopm=3) — suggests substantial internal behavior that could be moved into separate modules; moderate cohesion (lcom=0.333) implies the class likely contains multiple responsibilities or loosely related functionality; dependencies on multiple Gson types and internal roles (JsonArray, JsonObject, JsonElement, JsonSerializationContext, JsonDeserializationContext, JsonParseException, plus Builder and EnumSerialization) show it handles varied concerns (serialization, deserialization, enum handling, protobuf builder logic). These factors together justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and is a candidate for decomposition."
