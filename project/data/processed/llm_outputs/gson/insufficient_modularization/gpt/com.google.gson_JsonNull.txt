    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=38, NOM=4, WMC=4, NOF=1, NOPF=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and inheritance depth is shallow (DIT=1). Although LCOM=1.0 indicates low method-field cohesion, the overall size and low complexity do not support further decomposition; therefore there is no clear sign of insufficient modularization."
