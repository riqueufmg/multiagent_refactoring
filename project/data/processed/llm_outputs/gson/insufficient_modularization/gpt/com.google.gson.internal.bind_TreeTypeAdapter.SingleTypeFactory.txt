    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.TreeTypeAdapter.SingleTypeFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization: it is small (loc=22), has no methods (nom=0) and thus no internal behavioral complexity (wmc=0), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), shallow inheritance (dit=1), and a modest number of fields (nof=5). LCOM indicates no cohesion problem (lcom=-1.0). Its dependency list is short and light. These metrics indicate the class is simple and not a candidate for further decomposition."
