    "justification": "The class is small and simple: 45 LOC, 4 methods (3 public), 2 fields and WMC = 6. It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0) and shallow inheritance (DIT = 1). Although LCOM = 0.75 indicates some cohesion concern, the overall low size and complexity do not justify further decomposition in isolation."
