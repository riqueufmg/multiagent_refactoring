    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: number of methods (nom) = 0 and weighted methods per class (wmc) = 0 show no behavioral complexity to decompose; number of fields (nof) = 3 is small; lines of code (loc) = 54 is modest; coupling indicators fanin = 0 and fanout = 0 show no external dependency pressure; LCOM = -1.0 (not indicative of cohesion problems here). Given the lack of methods, low field count, low complexity and low coupling, there is no evidence this class needs further decomposition."
