    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: loc=50, number of fields=4 (nof=4), number of methods=0 (nom=0, nopm=0), weighted method complexity WMC=0, low cohesion metric lcom=-1.0, and no coupling recorded (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is no evidence of high size, high implementation complexity, or high coupling that would justify further decomposition; therefore Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
