    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and simple: LOC=28, number of fields (nof)=3, number of methods (nom)=0, WMC=0. Coupled with no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and DIT=0, there is no evidence of high size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The available cohesion metric (lcom=-1.0) does not suggest cohesion problems. Therefore, Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
