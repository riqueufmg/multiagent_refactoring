    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.TypeAdapters",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class exhibits signs of insufficient modularization: very large size (loc=681), high complexity (wmc=126), many methods and fields (nom=73, nof=51) with most being public (nopm=69, nopf=50), and low cohesion (lcom=0.9178082191780822). DIT=0 indicates responsibilities are concentrated in this single class. The wide set of dependencies (multiple TypeAdapter-related types) further suggests it aggregates many responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, focused classes."
