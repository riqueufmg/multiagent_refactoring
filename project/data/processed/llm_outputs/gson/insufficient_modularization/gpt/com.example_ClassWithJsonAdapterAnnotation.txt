    "justification": "Low cohesion (lcom = 0.6666666666666666) indicates multiple, weakly related responsibilities within the class. The class contains an inner/nested type (dependency: com.example.ClassWithJsonAdapterAnnotation.DummyClass) suggesting a candidate for extraction. Although overall complexity (wmc = 3) and method count (nom = 3) are low, the combination of non-trivial size (loc = 62) and high LCOM supports that further decomposition would improve modularity and reduce responsibility coupling."
