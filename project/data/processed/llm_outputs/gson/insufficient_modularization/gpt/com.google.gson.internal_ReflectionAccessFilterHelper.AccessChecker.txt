    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and non-complex: LOC=34, NOF=1, NOM=0, WMC=0, DIT=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. There are no methods to decompose and only a single field, with no incoming/outgoing dependencies. LCOM=-1.0 (no method cohesion data) further supports that there is no identifiable internal complexity or multiple responsibilities that would justify additional decomposition. Therefore there is no evidence of Insufficient Modularization."
