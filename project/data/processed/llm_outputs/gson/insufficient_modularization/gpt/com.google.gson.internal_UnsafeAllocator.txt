    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.UnsafeAllocator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=71, WMC=8, NOM=7 (NOPM=5) and only 1 field (NOF=1). LCOM=0.4286 indicates reasonable cohesion. It has no inheritance (DIT=0), no incoming/outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and only a single dependency (ConstructorConstructor). These metrics do not indicate an oversized or overly complex class that requires further decomposition, so Insufficient Modularization is not detected."
