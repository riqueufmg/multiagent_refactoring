    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag.Builder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of being insufficiently modular: very large size (loc = 470) while having no declared methods (nom = 0) and zero measured method complexity (wmc = 0), indicating the code is not decomposed into methods. It has few fields (nof = 5) so the large LOC is not explained by many fields, cohesion metric is anomalous (lcom = -1.0) and coupling indicators are minimal (fanin = 0, fanout = 0, dependencies only on itself). These factors together suggest the class contains a large amount of code without proper decomposition into smaller, modular units and should be refactored/decomposed."
