    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.LinkedTreeMap.Node",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a relatively large state (nof = 9 fields) and non-trivial size (loc = 83) while exposing no methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0). Having many fields with no methods in isolation suggests the class is aggregating multiple pieces of data / responsibilities that could be split into smaller, more focused types. The metrics (high nof, moderate LOC, zero methods) indicate insufficient decomposition and justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
