    "justification": "nom=20 and nopm=20 (many methods and a large public API), loc=167 (sizeable class) and wmc=21 (relatively high complexity) indicate substantial implementation concentrated in this single class. nof=1 (only one field, backed by LinkedTreeMap per dependencies) combined with dependencies on multiple Json element types (com.google.gson.JsonPrimitive, com.google.gson.JsonArray, com.google.gson.JsonElement, com.google.gson.JsonNull) suggests the class is handling multiple responsibilities/behaviors around different element types. Even though lcom=0.1 shows methods are cohesive, the large number of public methods and overall complexity justify decomposing the class to reduce size and implementation complexity."
