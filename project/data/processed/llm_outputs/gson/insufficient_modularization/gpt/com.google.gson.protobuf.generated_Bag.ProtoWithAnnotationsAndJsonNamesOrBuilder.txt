    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag.ProtoWithAnnotationsAndJsonNamesOrBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No evidence of insufficient modularization: zero methods (nom=0) and zero fields (nof=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). LOC=62 alone, without behavioral elements, does not indicate an undecomposed class. Therefore the class does not exhibit the Insufficient Modularization smell in isolation."
