    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large and complex for a single unit: loc=208 and WMC=29 indicate substantial size and high cyclomatic complexity. It has only nom=7 methods (nopm=2 public methods), so the complexity is concentrated in relatively few methods, suggesting methods are doing multiple responsibilities and could be decomposed. Although LCOM=0.2857 shows reasonable cohesion, it does not offset the high size/complexity metrics. Fanin=0 and Fanout=0 indicate the class is isolated and likely carrying multiple responsibilities itself. Together these metrics point to Insufficient Modularization: the class should be further decomposed to reduce size and per-method complexity."
