    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonSyntaxException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and low-complexity: LOC=21, WMC=3, NOM=3, NOF=1 and DIT=1. Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class has few responsibilities and low implementation complexity, so there is no evidence it needs further decomposition. Although LCOM=1.0 suggests limited method-field sharing, given the very small size and limited method count this does not by itself justify splitting the class."
