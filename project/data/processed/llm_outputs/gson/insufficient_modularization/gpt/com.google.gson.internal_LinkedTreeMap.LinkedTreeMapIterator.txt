    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.LinkedTreeMap.LinkedTreeMapIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No evidence of insufficient modularization: small size (loc=30), no measurable complexity (wmc=0), no methods (nom=0) so there is no large behaviour to decompose, only 3 fields (nof=3), minimal inheritance depth (dit=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class is small and simple in isolation, not a candidate for further decomposition."
