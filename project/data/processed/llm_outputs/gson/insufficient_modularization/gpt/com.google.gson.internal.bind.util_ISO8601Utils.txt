    "justification": "Class has high size and complexity: LOC = 264 and WMC = 38, with NOM = 9 (NOPM = 4) indicating relatively few public methods but substantial internal complexity. These values point to large/complex methods and overall class bulk that could be decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity. Although LCOM = 0.222 suggests reasonable cohesion, the absolute size and weighted complexity justify detecting Insufficient Modularization."
