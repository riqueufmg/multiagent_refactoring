    "justification": "The class is minimal and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=5, nom=0 (no methods), nof=0 (no fields), wmc=0 (no complexity), fanin=0 and fanout=0 (no coupling), and no dependencies. lcom=-1.0 indicates lack of applicable cohesion data. These metrics show no size or complexity that would justify Insufficient Modularization."
