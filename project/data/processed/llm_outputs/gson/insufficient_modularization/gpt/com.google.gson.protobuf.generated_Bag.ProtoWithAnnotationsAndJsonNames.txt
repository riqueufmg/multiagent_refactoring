    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag.ProtoWithAnnotationsAndJsonNames",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is very large (loc = 846) and holds many fields (nof = 18, nopf = 4), indicating multiple responsibilities concentrated in one type. Cohesion metric is not reliable (lcom = -1.0) and cyclomatic/complexity metrics are unavailable (wmc = 0), so size and field count are the primary indicators. The file path and dependency on com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag further suggest this generated class bundles substantial data/behavior. These elements together justify that the class is insufficiently modularized and a candidate for decomposition."
