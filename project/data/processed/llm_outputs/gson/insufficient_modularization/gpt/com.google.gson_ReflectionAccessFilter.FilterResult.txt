    "justification": "Metrics indicate the class is small and not complex: loc=18, nom=0, wmc=0, lcom=-1.0, fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]. There are no methods or measurable complexity to justify further decomposition; coupling and size are minimal. Given these values (and considering the class in isolation), this does not meet the criteria for Insufficient Modularization."
