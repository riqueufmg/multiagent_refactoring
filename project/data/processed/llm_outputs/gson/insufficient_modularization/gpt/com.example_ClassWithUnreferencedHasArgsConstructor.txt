    "justification": "The class is very small and simple: LOC=9, WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=1. Cohesion is high (LCOM=0.0) and there are no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate no need for further decomposition, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
