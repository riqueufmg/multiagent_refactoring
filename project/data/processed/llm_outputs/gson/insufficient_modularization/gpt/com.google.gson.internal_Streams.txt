    "justification": "LCOM=1.0 indicates very low cohesion among the class's methods. The class has LOC=108 with only nom=4 methods (nopm=3 public), suggesting relatively large or multi-purpose methods. WMC=5 shows non-trivial internal complexity. The dependency set (JsonReader, JsonWriter, JsonElement, JsonElementTypeAdapter, JsonToken, JsonParseException, JsonNull, Streams.CurrentWrite) indicates the class touches parsing, writing, element conversion and error handling concerns. These factors together point to multiple responsibilities in a single class and justify flagging Insufficient Modularization."
