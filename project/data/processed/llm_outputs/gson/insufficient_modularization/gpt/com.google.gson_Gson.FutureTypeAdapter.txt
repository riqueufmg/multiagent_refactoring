    "justification": "Metrics indicate a small, simple, and cohesive class: LOC=29, NOF=1, NOM=0, WMC=0, NOPF=0, NOPM=0. Coupling is low (fanin=0, fanout=0) with a single declared dependency (com.google.gson.TypeAdapter). DIT=2 does not by itself imply an undecomposed class, and LCOM=-1.0 indicates high cohesion. There is no evidence of large size, high complexity, or multiple responsibilities that would justify further decomposition."
