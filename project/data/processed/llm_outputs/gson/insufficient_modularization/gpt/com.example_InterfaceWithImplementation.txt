    "justification": "Class has very small size and complexity (loc=14, wmc=1), minimal surface (nom=1, nopm=0, nof=1), high cohesion (lcom=-1.0) and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). These metrics indicate the class is already minimal and well-focused, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
