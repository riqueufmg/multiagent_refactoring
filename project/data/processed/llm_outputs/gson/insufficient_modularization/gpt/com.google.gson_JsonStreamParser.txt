    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonStreamParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class is small and not overly complex (LOC=70, WMC=6), has few methods and fields (nom=5, nof=2), moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.6) and no high coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics do not suggest an incompletely decomposed class that would benefit from further modularization."
