    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonTreeReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows multiple signals that it has not been fully decomposed: a high number of methods (NOM = 30) with many public methods (NOPM = 22) indicates substantial API/behavior surface; high complexity (WMC = 70) and large size (LOC = 285) indicate implementation complexity concentrated in one class; a small number of fields (NOF = 6) suggests the logic is implemented in-method rather than delegated to collaborators; low inheritance depth (DIT = 1) means decomposition via hierarchy is not being used; dependencies on multiple Json element types (JsonPrimitive, JsonToken, JsonArray, JsonElement, JsonObject) imply the class handles several distinct responsibilities (different JSON element forms). Taken together these factors justify that the class is a candidate for further modularization (decomposition into smaller classes/components)."
