    "class": "com.google.gson.interceptors.InterceptorFactory.InterceptorAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class analyzed in isolation shows no signs of Insufficient Modularization: small size (LOC = 21), no methods (NOM = 0) and zero complexity (WMC = 0), minimal fields (NOF = 2), low coupling (fanin = 0, fanout = 0), and no elevated inheritance depth (DIT = 1). These metrics indicate the class is compact and not a candidate for further decomposition based on the provided data."
