    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate an under-modularized class: small size (loc=42), few fields (nof=2) and a moderate number of methods (nom=6, nopm=4) consistent with a focused utility/adaptor role. Cohesion is acceptable (lcom=0.5) and there are no incoming/outgoing coupling signals (fanin=0, fanout=0) that would suggest multiple responsibilities split across modules. Although WMC=10 shows some method complexity, given the small LOC and expected use of several Gson-related dependencies (TypeToken, JsonReader/Writer, ToNumberPolicy/Strategy, TypeAdapter, Gson) the complexity likely stems from necessary parsing logic rather than mixed responsibilities; therefore further decomposition is not clearly warranted in isolation."
