    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonDeserializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and simple: LOC=16, number of methods (nom)=1, weighted method count (wmc)=1, number of fields (nof)=0. Low coupling indicators: fanin=0, fanout=0 and only three lightweight dependencies. These metrics show low size and low implementation complexity, so there is no evidence that the class needs further decomposition."
