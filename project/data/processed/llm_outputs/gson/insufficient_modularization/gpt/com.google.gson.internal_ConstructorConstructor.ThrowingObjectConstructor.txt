    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: very small size (loc=12), no methods (nom=0) and no measured complexity (wmc=0) imply the class is minimal; low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and shallow inheritance (dit=1) show no hidden responsibilities to split; LCOM is not indicating cohesion issues. Based on these elements the class does not appear to require further decomposition."
