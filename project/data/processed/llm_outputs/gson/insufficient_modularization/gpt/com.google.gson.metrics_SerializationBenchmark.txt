    "justification": "Although LCOM is 0.6667 (indicating moderate lack of cohesion), the class is very small (LOC=23) with few methods (nom=3), low complexity (WMC=4), and no external coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). The overall size and low implementation complexity do not justify further decomposition in isolation."
