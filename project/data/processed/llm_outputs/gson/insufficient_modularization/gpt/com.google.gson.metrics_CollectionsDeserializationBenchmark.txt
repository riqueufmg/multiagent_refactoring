    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.CollectionsDeserializationBenchmark",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class shows signs of insufficient modularization: relatively large size (loc=107) combined with high complexity (wmc=23) while exposing few methods (nom=5, nopm=4) — suggesting large, complex methods that could be decomposed. Cohesion metric is moderate/low (lcom=0.4), indicating the class may be handling multiple concerns. It also has multiple fields (nof=4) and depends on varied responsibilities (com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken, com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader, com.google.gson.Gson, com.google.gson.metrics.NonUploadingCaliperRunner, com.google.gson.metrics.BagOfPrimitives), which implies mixing parsing/format concerns and benchmarking setup. Given these indicators in isolation, the class likely would benefit from further decomposition."
