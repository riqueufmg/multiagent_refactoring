    "justification": "The class is very small and not a candidate for further decomposition: LOC=6, NOM=0 (no methods), WMC=0 (no complexity), NOF=1 (single field). Coupling is minimal (fanin=0, fanout=0) and there are no methods to split; therefore there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
