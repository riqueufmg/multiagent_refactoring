    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonParseException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and simple: LOC=30, WMC=3, NOM=3, NOF=1. It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no inheritance depth (DIT=0), indicating limited responsibility and low implementation complexity. Although LCOM=1.0 suggests low cohesion, given the small number of methods (likely constructors) and a single field this is expected for an exception holder and does not indicate a need for further decomposition. Overall metrics do not support Insufficient Modularization."
