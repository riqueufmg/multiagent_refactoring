    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: small size (loc=31), few methods (nom=4, nopm=1), no fields (nof=0), and high cohesion (lcom=-1.0). Although cyclomatic/weighted method complexity is moderately high (wmc=12), the class is small and has limited public API surface, so there is no clear evidence that it should be further decomposed."
