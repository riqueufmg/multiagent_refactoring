    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Metrics indicate a likely case of Insufficient Modularization: very large size (loc = 483) and high implementation complexity (wmc = 80) combined with many methods (nom = 22) and many public methods (nopm = 13) suggest the class holds multiple responsibilities and implementation detail that could be split. The class has a non-trivial number of fields (nof = 10) while cohesion is only moderate (lcom = 0.318), which is consistent with several cohesive subsets inside the same class. There is no inheritance-based decomposition (dit = 0, nc = 0) to offset the size/complexity, so further decomposition into smaller classes or helper components would likely reduce size and complexity."
