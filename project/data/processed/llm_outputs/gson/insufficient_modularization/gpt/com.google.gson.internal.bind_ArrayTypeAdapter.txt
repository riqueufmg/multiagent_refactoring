    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.ArrayTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class is small and focused: LOC=61, NOM=4 and NOF=3 indicate a limited surface area. Complexity is moderate (WMC=11) but spread across few methods, and cohesion is acceptable (LCOM=0.5). Inheritance depth is low (DIT=1) and coupling appears low (Fanin=0, Fanout=0). Given these metrics, there is no evidence that the class is large or overly complex such that further decomposition would clearly reduce size or implementation complexity."
