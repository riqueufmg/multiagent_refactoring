    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: the class is small (loc=30), has no reported methods or fields (nom=0, nopm=0, nof=0, nopf=0), zero complexity (wmc=0), and no coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, dependencies=[]). These values suggest the class is not overly large or complex and does not need further decomposition in isolation."
