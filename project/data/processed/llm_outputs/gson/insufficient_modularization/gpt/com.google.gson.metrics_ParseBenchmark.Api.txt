    "justification": "Metrics show a small, simple class not requiring further decomposition: LOC=32, NOM=0, NOF=0, NOPF=0, WMC=0, NC=0, DIT=0, FANIN=0, FANOUT=0. The class has no methods or fields and zero complexity/coupling, so there is no evidence of a large or complex unit that would benefit from additional modularization."
