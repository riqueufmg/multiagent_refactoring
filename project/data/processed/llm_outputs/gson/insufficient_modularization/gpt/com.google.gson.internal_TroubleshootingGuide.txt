    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.TroubleshootingGuide",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class is small and cohesive: LOC=10, WMC=2 (low complexity), NOM=2 (only two methods, NOPM=1), NOF=0 (no fields), LCOM=-1.0 (indicates high cohesion), and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics show the class is simple and well modularized, so there is no evidence that it requires further decomposition."
