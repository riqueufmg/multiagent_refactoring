    "class": "com.example.ClassWithJsonAdapterAnnotation.Deserializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has very small size and no internal structure: LOC=5, NOF=0, NOM=0, NOPM=0, WMC=0, NC=0. No fields or methods to decompose and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). Given these metrics and considering the class in isolation, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
