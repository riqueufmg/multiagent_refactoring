    "justification": "Class is small and reasonably cohesive: LOC=65, NOM=4, NOF=4. Complexity is moderate (WMC=12) but spread over few methods (average complexity ~3). Cohesion LCOM=0.5 indicates no strong evidence of multi-responsibility. Low inheritance depth (DIT=1) and no reported external coupling via fanin/fanout (0) reduce need for further decomposition. Given these metrics, there is insufficient evidence that the class is insufficiently modularized."
