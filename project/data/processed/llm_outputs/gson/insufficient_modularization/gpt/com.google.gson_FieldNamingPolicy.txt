    "justification": "Metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization: loc=102 and nom=9 show a modest size and number of methods; wmc=15 indicates only moderate complexity; lcom=-1.0 (high cohesion) suggests the methods are related; dit=1 shows minimal inheritance depth; fanin/fanout=0 and no dependencies imply no hidden coupling. Together these metrics point to a reasonably cohesive, moderately sized class that does not require further decomposition."
