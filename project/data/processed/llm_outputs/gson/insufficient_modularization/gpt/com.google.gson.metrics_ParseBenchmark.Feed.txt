    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: The class is small and low-complexity. Metrics show 16 LOC, WMC=0 and NOM=0 (no methods), indicating little implementation complexity to decompose. Although NOF=6 (six fields), the absence of methods and very low size suggest this is a simple data holder rather than a large, undecomposed class. LCOM is not meaningfully positive and fanin/fanout are 0, giving no evidence of internal complexity or coupling that would justify further modularization."
