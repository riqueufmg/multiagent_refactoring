    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.ParseBenchmark",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High number of fields (nof = 81) combined with relatively few methods (nom = 5, nopm = 2) and substantial size (loc = 295) indicates the class is carrying a large amount of data/responsibility and has not been decomposed. The presence of multiple nested/related types in the dependency list (ParseBenchmark.Content, ParseBenchmark.Document, ParseBenchmark.Tweet, ParseBenchmark.Parser, ParseBenchmark.Api, ParseBenchmark.User) suggests natural candidates for extraction into separate classes. WMC = 9 is modest (behavioral complexity is low relative to the amount of state), and LCOM = 0.4 does not show strong cohesion sufficient to justify 81 fields in one class. These elements together justify that the class exhibits Insufficient Modularization."
