    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonArray",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class is large and complex: loc=281, nom=33, wmc=37 and nopm=32 (many public methods), which indicates many responsibilities. It maintains only a single field (nof=1) and has few external dependencies (com.google.gson.JsonNull, com.google.gson.JsonElement), implying those responsibilities are implemented inside the class rather than delegated. Low inheritance depth (dit=1) and the high method count point to a candidate for further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
