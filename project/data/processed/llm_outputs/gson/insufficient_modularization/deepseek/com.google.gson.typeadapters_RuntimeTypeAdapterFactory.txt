    "class": "com.google.gson.typeadapters.RuntimeTypeAdapterFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (129 LOC, 10 methods) with low complexity (WMC 30, LCOM 0.0). It shows good cohesion and no indication of multiple responsibilities that would require decomposition. The number of fields (6) and methods is reasonable for a factory class implementing type adaptation logic."
