    "justification": "High WMC (70) and LOC (285) indicate significant complexity. Large number of methods (30) with 22 public methods suggests multiple responsibilities. Low LCOM (0.1) suggests high cohesion, but the size and complexity metrics exceed typical single-responsibility thresholds, indicating insufficient decomposition."
