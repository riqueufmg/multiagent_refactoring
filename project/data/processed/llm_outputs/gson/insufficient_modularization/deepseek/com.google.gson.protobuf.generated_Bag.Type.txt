    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Class has only 6 fields (3 public) and 0 methods, with 80 LOC and 0 WMC. No methods exist to decompose, and field count is low. LCOM of -1 indicates no methods to group, suggesting it's a simple data container rather than a class with insufficient modularization."
