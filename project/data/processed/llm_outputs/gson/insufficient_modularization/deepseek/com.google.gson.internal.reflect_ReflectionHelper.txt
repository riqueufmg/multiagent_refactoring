{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.reflect.ReflectionHelper",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has 16 methods (nom=16) with 218 lines of code (loc=218) and moderate complexity (wmc=23), suggesting multiple responsibilities. The presence of an inner class 'RecordHelper' as a dependency indicates partial decomposition, but the main class remains large with 5 fields and 12 public methods, indicating insufficient modularization."
