    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity (WMC=23, LOC=51) with only 5 methods, all but one being public static utility methods. It has no fields, no dependencies, and serves a single, cohesive purpose of primitive type operations. Further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity meaningfully."
