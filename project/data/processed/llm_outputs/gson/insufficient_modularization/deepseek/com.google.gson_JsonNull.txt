    "justification": "Class has minimal size (38 LOC, 4 methods) and complexity (WMC=4, LCOM=1.0 indicates no cohesion issues). All methods are public (nom=nopm=4), suggesting a focused, single-responsibility design. No dependencies indicate self-contained functionality. Further decomposition would not reduce size or complexity meaningfully."
