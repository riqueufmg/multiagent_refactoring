    "class": "com.example.NoSerializedNameMain",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class contains 3 inner classes (TestClassNoArgsConstructor, TestClassNotAbstract, TestClassHasArgsConstructor) that could be decomposed into separate classes. The presence of multiple inner classes with distinct responsibilities suggests insufficient modularization, as moving these inner classes to their own files would reduce the size and complexity of the main class."
