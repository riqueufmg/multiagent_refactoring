{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.ObjectTypeAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) and a weighted method complexity of 28 (wmc=28), indicating significant implementation complexity. With only 3 fields (nof=3) and 119 lines of code (loc=119), the class handles multiple responsibilities including JSON reading, writing, and type adaptation logic, suggesting it could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce complexity."
