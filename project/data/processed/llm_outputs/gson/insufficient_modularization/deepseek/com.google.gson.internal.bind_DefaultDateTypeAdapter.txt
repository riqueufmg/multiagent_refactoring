    "justification": "The class has moderate size (115 LOC, 15 WMC) and complexity (LCOM 0.375). It has 8 methods with 5 public methods, 6 fields with 2 public fields, and 0 nested classes. The dependencies are focused on JSON processing and date handling, which is cohesive for a date type adapter. No clear indicators of insufficient decomposition exist given its focused responsibility."
