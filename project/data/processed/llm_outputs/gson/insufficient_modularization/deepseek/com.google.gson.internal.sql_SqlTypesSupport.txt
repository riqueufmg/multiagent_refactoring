    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.sql.SqlTypesSupport",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods and 51 LOC, which is small. It has 6 fields but all are public static final (constants based on nopf=6, nopm=0), indicating configuration data rather than complex state. The LCOM of 1.0 suggests all methods use all fields, which is expected for a utility class providing related constants and factory methods. No evidence of high implementation complexity or need for further decomposition."
