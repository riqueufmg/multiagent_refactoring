    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields and 0 methods, with 40 lines of code, indicating minimal implementation complexity. No methods exist to decompose, and the low field count suggests the class is already a simple data structure. LCOM of -1.0 indicates no cohesion issues, and the class has no incoming or outgoing dependencies beyond basic type references."
