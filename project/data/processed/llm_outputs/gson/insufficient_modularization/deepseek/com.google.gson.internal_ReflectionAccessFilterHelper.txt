    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.ReflectionAccessFilterHelper",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) with 5 being public (nopm=5) and only 1 field (nof=1), indicating multiple responsibilities concentrated in one class. The high LCOM value (1.0) suggests low cohesion among methods, and the presence of an inner class dependency shows partial decomposition has occurred but further modularization is possible to reduce complexity."
