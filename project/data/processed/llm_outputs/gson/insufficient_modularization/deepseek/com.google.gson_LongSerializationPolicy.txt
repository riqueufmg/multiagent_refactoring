    "class": "com.google.gson.LongSerializationPolicy",

    "justification": "Class has only 3 methods (nom=3) and 35 lines of code (loc=35), which is small. All methods are public (nopm=3), indicating a focused interface. Low weighted method count (wmc=5) and negative LCOM (-1.0) suggest high cohesion. No fields (nof=0) or complex internal state. The class appears to be a simple, cohesive enumeration or policy class with minimal implementation complexity."
