{
    "class": "com.google.gson.FieldNamingPolicy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods with 7 public methods, 102 LOC, and a WMC of 15. These metrics indicate a moderate size and complexity. The class has no fields (nof=0, nopf=0) and no dependencies, suggesting it is a focused, stateless utility/enum class. The LCOM value of -1 is typical for classes with only static methods or enums. The class appears sufficiently decomposed for its purpose as a naming policy container."
