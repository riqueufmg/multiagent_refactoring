    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonElementTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=117, WMC=29, NOM=5) with only one field and minimal dependencies. The LCOM value of 0.6 indicates moderate cohesion, and the class already implements a focused TypeAdapter pattern for JsonElement without excessive responsibilities."
