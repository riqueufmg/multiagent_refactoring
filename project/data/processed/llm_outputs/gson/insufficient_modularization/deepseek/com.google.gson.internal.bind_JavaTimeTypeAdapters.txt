    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.JavaTimeTypeAdapters",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: 33 methods (nom), 317 lines of code (loc), and 82 weighted methods per class (wmc). It has only 1 public field (nopf) and 12 public methods (nopm), indicating most of its 33 methods are internal, non-public helper methods. The high LCOM value (0.88) suggests low cohesion among methods. The class implements multiple type adapters for Java Time API types, which could be decomposed into separate, smaller classes for each temporal type or logical grouping."
