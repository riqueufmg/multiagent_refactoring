    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.MapTypeAdapterFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=4, LOC=147, NOM=3) and already contains an inner adapter class for decomposition. LCOM=0 indicates good cohesion, and the dependencies are typical for a factory class in a serialization framework."
