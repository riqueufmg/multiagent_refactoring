    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonAdapterAnnotationTypeAdapterFactory.DummyTypeAdapterFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has minimal implementation (LOC: 5, WMC: 0, NOF: 0, NOM: 0) and no dependencies, indicating it likely serves a trivial placeholder purpose. Its existence as a separate class suggests it could potentially be eliminated or merged to reduce overall system complexity."
