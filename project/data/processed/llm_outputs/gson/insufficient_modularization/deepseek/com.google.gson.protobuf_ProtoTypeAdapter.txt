```json
{
    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.ProtoTypeAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 9 methods, 14 fields, 243 lines of code, and weighted method complexity of 32. The LCOM value of 0.33 indicates moderate cohesion, suggesting the class handles multiple responsibilities that could be separated. The presence of inner classes (Builder, EnumSerialization) and dependencies on multiple JSON types suggests it manages both serialization and deserialization logic for protocol buffers, which could be decomposed into specialized adapters."
