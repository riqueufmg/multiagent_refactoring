    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has high method count (nom=19), high WMC (wmc=19), and high LOC (loc=173) indicating it likely handles multiple responsibilities. Low cohesion (lcom=-1.0) suggests unrelated methods grouped together. Single public method (nopm=1) with many private/internal methods suggests insufficient decomposition."
