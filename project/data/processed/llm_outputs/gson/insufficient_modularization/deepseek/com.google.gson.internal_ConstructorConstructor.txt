{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.ConstructorConstructor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 12 methods (nom=12) and 262 lines of code (loc=262), indicating substantial size and complexity. With only 4 public methods (nopm=4), the majority of methods are non-public, suggesting internal helper methods that could be extracted into separate classes. The high weighted method count (wmc=47) further indicates significant implementation complexity that could benefit from decomposition."
