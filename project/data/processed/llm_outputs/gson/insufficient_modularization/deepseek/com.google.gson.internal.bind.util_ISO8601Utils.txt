    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) and 264 lines of code (loc=264), indicating high implementation complexity and size. The lack of decomposition is evident from having all functionality in a single utility class with no dependencies, suggesting it could be broken down into smaller, more focused modules."
