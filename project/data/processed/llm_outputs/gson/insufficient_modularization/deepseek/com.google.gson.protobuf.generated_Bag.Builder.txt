    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag.Builder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 470 lines of code (loc) and 5 fields (nof), indicating a large monolithic structure. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) suggests all logic is implemented elsewhere in the class, leading to high implementation complexity that could be reduced through decomposition into smaller, focused modules."
