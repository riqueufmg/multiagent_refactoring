```json
{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.LinkedTreeMap",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "High LOC (504) and WMC (58) indicate large size and complexity. High number of methods (24) and fields (21) suggest multiple responsibilities. Low LCOM (0.25) shows high cohesion, but the class contains inner classes (KeySet, EntrySet, Node) that could be further decomposed or externalized. The combination of metrics suggests insufficient decomposition despite existing inner classes."
