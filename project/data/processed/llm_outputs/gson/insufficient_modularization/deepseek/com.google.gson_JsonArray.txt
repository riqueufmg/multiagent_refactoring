    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonArray",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high method count (nom=33, nopm=32), high lines of code (loc=281), and high weighted method count (wmc=37), indicating it could be decomposed to reduce size and complexity. The low LCOM (0.0) suggests high cohesion, but the overall size and method count still justify further modularization."
