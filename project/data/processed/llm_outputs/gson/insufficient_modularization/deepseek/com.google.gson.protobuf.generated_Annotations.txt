    "justification": "The class has 4 methods (nom=4) and 5 fields (nof=5) with a high LCOM value (0.75), indicating low cohesion among its members. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and dependencies suggests it is a standalone utility class that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused units to reduce complexity."
