    "class": "com.google.gson.graph.GraphAdapterBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 11 fields (nof=11) and 5 methods (nom=5) with 228 lines of code (loc=228), indicating a large and potentially complex class. The low number of methods relative to fields (LCOM=0.4 suggests some cohesion but not high) and the presence of inner classes (GraphAdapterBuilder.Factory, GraphAdapterBuilder.Element) in dependencies suggest decomposition into these inner classes has started but may be insufficient. The class could be further decomposed to reduce its size and complexity."
