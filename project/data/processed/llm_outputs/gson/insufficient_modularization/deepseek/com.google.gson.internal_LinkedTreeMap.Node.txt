    "justification": "The class has 9 fields (nof=9) but 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 lines of code in methods (wmc=0, loc=83 includes only field declarations and possibly a constructor). It appears to be a simple data structure (node) with no implementation complexity to decompose further. No dependencies indicate it is already a minimal, self-contained unit."
