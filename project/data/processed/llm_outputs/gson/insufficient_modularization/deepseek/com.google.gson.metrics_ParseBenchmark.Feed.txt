    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields and 16 lines of code with no methods, indicating minimal implementation complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low WMC (0) suggest no internal behavior to decompose. The negative LCOM (-1.0) implies no cohesion issues. The class size and structure are already minimal."
