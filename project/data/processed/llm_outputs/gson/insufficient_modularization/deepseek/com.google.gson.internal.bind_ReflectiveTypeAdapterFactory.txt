    "justification": "Class has high complexity (WMC=56, LOC=407) and many methods (NOM=14) with moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.36). It contains inner classes (FieldsData, BoundField) and manages multiple responsibilities including field reflection, binding, and adapter creation, indicating insufficient decomposition."
