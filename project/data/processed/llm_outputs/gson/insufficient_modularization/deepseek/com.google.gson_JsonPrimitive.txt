    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Class has high complexity (WMC=40, LOC=215, NOM=23) with only one field (NOF=1), indicating multiple responsibilities concentrated in a single class. Low LCOM (0.087) suggests high method cohesion around the single field, but the large number of methods and high WMC show excessive implementation complexity that could be reduced through decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
