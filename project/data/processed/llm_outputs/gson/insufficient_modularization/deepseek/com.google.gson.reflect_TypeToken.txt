    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics: LOC (285) and WMC (64) are substantial, and it contains 22 methods (nom) with only 12 being public (nopm), indicating many internal helper methods. The LCOM (0.18) suggests low cohesion, and the presence of only 3 fields (nof) relative to many methods further indicates potential insufficient decomposition of responsibilities."
