    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (LOC=45, WMC=6, NOM=4) and high cohesion (LCOM=0.75). It implements a single, well-defined responsibility as a TypeAdapter for SQL Time. The number of methods is minimal and focused, with no indication of multiple responsibilities that would require further decomposition."
