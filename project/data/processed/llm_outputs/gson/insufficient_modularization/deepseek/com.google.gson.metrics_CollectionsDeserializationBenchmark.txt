    "justification": "Class has 5 methods (nom=5) with 4 being public (nopm=4) and 107 lines of code (loc=107), indicating multiple responsibilities. The weighted methods per class (wmc=23) is high, suggesting high implementation complexity. The lack of cohesion metric (lcom=0.4) shows some method groups that could be separated into distinct modules."
