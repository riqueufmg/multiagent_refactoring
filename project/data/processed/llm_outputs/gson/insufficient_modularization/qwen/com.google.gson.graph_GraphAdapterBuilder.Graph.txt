    "class": "com.google.gson.graph.GraphAdapterBuilder.Graph",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 3 fields, 0 methods, 23 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The low number of fields and methods indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple data structure rather than a complex class requiring modularization."
