    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 12 lines of code, 1 field, 0 methods, and 0 complexity metrics (wmc=0, nom=0). It appears to be a simple, minimal class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low LOC, minimal fields, and absence of methods or complexity indicate it is already well-decomposed rather than being a large, complex class that needs further decomposition."
