    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 fields, 0 methods, 0 lines of code in methods, and only 8 total lines of code. WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, and there are no dependencies or coupling issues. The class appears to be a simple, well-decomposed adapter implementation that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
