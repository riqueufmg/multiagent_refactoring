    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.DefaultDateTypeAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 8 methods (nom=8) with a weighted method count of 15 (wmc=15), indicating moderate complexity. The class handles multiple responsibilities including date formatting, parsing, and type adaptation with 115 lines of code (loc=115). It has 6 fields (nof=6) that manage different date format configurations and adapters. The class directly depends on 11 external classes, showing high coupling to various date-related utilities and Gson framework components. The lack of complete decomposition is evident as this single class manages both the type adapter logic and the date format handling, which could be separated into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
