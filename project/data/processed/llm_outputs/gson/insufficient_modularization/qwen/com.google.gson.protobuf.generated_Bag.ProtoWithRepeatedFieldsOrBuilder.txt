    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag.ProtoWithRepeatedFieldsOrBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is an interface or marker class rather than a complex class that needs decomposition. While it has 53 lines of code (loc=53), this is likely due to generated code or documentation rather than complex implementation logic. The lack of methods and fields suggests this class does not contain implementation complexity that would benefit from further modularization."
