    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2), 0 public methods (nopm=0), 20 lines of code (loc=20), and weighted method count of 2 (wmc=2). These metrics indicate a very small and simple class that is already well-decomposed. The class appears to be a minimal interface or abstract class with no complex functionality that would require further decomposition."
