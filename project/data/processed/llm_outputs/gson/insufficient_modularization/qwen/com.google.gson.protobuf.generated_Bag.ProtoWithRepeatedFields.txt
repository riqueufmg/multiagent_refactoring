{
    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag.ProtoWithRepeatedFields",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 16 fields (nof=16) and 876 lines of code (loc=876), indicating high complexity and size that suggests insufficient modularization. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and high field count suggests this class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The large number of fields without corresponding behavior indicates a data-heavy class that violates the principle of encapsulation and separation of concerns."
