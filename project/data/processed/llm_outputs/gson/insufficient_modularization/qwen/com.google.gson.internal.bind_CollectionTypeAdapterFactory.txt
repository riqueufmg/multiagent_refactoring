```json
{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.CollectionTypeAdapterFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 2 methods (nom=2), 3 fields (nof=3), and a low weighted method count (wmc=3). The lines of code (loc=56) are minimal, and the lack of coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it's focused on a single responsibility. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion within the class."
