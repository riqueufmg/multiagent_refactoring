    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.ParseBenchmark",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 81 fields (nof=81) and 295 lines of code (loc=295), indicating high size and complexity. It contains multiple nested classes (Tweet, User, Api, Parser, Content, Document) suggesting it could be decomposed into separate classes. The high number of fields and presence of multiple logical entities within a single class indicate insufficient modularization where further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity."
