    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.sql.SqlTimeTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=6, LOC=45, NOM=4) and reasonable cohesion (LCOM=0.75). While it has 2 fields and 4 methods, the size and complexity are within acceptable ranges for a type adapter implementation. The class appears to be properly focused on its single responsibility of handling SQL time type adaptation."
