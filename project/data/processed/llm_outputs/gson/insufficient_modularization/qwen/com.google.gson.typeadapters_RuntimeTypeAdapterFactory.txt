{
    "class": "com.google.gson.typeadapters.RuntimeTypeAdapterFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 30 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 10 with 9 being public methods suggesting high functional complexity, LOC (Lines of Code) is 129 indicating substantial implementation size, and the class has 6 fields with 0 public fields suggesting potential for better decomposition. The high method count and complexity suggest this class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
