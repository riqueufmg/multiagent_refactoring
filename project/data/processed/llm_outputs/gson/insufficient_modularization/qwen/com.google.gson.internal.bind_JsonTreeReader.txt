```json
{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonTreeReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 30 methods (nom=30) with 22 public methods (nopm=22), high weighted method count (wmc=70), and 285 lines of code (loc=285). These metrics indicate high complexity and size that could benefit from further decomposition into smaller, more manageable modules. The class implements multiple responsibilities for handling JSON tree reading operations, suggesting insufficient modularization."
