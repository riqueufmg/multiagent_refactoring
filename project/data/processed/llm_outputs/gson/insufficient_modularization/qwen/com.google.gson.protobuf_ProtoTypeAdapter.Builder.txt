    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.ProtoTypeAdapter.Builder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 6 fields (nof=6) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a relatively small size of 55 lines of code (loc=55). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0) and minimal complexity indicates this is a simple data holder or configuration class that does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be appropriately decomposed for its current functionality."
