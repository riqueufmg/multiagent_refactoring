{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.sql.SqlTypesSupport",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=0), low WMC (3), and minimal lines of code (loc=51). The class has reasonable cohesion (lcom=1.0) and manages a small set of fields (nof=6, nopf=6). While it has dependencies on 4 other classes, the size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization - the class appears appropriately sized and decomposed for its functionality."
