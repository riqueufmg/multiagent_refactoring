    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.reflect.ReflectionHelper",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 16 methods (nom=16) with 12 public methods (nopm=12), high WMC of 23 indicating complex internal logic, and 218 lines of code (loc=218). The high method count and complexity suggest the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity."
