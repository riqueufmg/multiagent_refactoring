    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is likely an interface or marker class with minimal functionality. With only 59 lines of code and no complex metrics (wmc=0, nc=0), this appears to be a simple, well-modularized component that does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
