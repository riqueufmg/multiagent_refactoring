    "class": "com.google.gson.interceptors.JsonPostDeserializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1) and 10 lines of code (loc=10), with no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). The low number of methods and small size indicate it is already well decomposed. WMC=1 shows minimal complexity, and the absence of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests it is properly modularized."
