{
    "class": "com.google.gson.FieldNamingPolicy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) with 7 public methods (nopm=7), 102 lines of code (loc=102), and weighted method count of 15 (wmc=15). While the class has moderate complexity, it represents a cohesive enumeration of field naming policies and does not exhibit excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and single inheritance level (dit=1) indicate proper modularization."
