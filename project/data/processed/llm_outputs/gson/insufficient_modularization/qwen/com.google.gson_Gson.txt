    "class": "com.google.gson.Gson",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has a high number of methods (51 total, 43 public), a high Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) value of 104, and a large Lines of Code (LOC) count of 826. These metrics indicate high complexity and suggest that the class could benefit from further decomposition to reduce its size and implementation complexity."
