    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (nom=2, nopm=2) and 27 lines of code (loc=27), which indicates a small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=2) is low, suggesting low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1, nopf=1) and no class dependencies (nc=0, dit=0, fanin=0, fanout=0), the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization."
