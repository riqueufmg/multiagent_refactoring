{
    "class": com.google.gson.internal.bind.JavaTimeTypeAdapters,
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 33 methods (nom), 82 weighted method count (wmc), and 317 lines of code (loc). The lack of modularization is evident through the high number of methods and complexity metrics, suggesting the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused components. The LCOM value of 0.8787878787878788 indicates poor cohesion, supporting the need for better modularization."
