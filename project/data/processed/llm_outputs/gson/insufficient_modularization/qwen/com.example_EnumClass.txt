    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with 1 line of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and WMC of 0. There are no implementation details or dependencies that would indicate insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple enumeration or placeholder with no substantive functionality to decompose."
