    "justification": "Class has 0 methods (nom=0) and 0 fields (nof=0), indicating it is an empty or placeholder class that does not exhibit complexity requiring further decomposition. The low LOC count (17) is consistent with a minimal class structure rather than a complex implementation needing modularization."
