    "class": "com.example.GenericClasses",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 39 lines of code which is relatively small, and contains only 4 fields. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest it's already well-decomposed. While it contains nested classes (GenericClass and DummyClass), the overall size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
