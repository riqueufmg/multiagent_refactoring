{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.SerializationDelegatingTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), low lines of code (loc=9), single inheritance level (dit=1), and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0). The weighted method count is minimal (wmc=1) and there are only 2 nested classes (nc=2). These metrics indicate the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
