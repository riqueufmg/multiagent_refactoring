{
    "class": "com.google.gson.graph.GraphAdapterBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with 228 lines of code (LOC) and 7 weighted method complexity (WMC) for only 5 methods, indicating dense implementation. The class also has 11 fields (NOF) and 10 external dependencies, suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities. The lack of inheritance (DIT=0) and low cohesion (LCOM=0.4) further indicate insufficient decomposition of responsibilities into separate modules."
