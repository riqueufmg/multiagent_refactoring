{
    "class": "com.google.gson.ToNumberPolicy",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 5 methods (nom=5), 4 public methods (nopm=4), and 67 lines of code (loc=67). The weighted method count is low (wmc=7) and it has a simple inheritance hierarchy (dit=1). The class appears to be well-focused with a single responsibility related to number parsing policies, and its size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization."
