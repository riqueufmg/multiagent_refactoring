    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.TypeAdapterRuntimeTypeWrapper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 5 methods (nom=5) and 11 weighted method count (wmc=11), which is manageable. The lines of code (loc=53) is relatively small. The lack of class-level dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and low coupling (lcom=0.0) suggest good modularization. The depth of inheritance (dit=1) indicates no complex inheritance hierarchy. While the class has some complexity, it does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization given its size and complexity metrics."
