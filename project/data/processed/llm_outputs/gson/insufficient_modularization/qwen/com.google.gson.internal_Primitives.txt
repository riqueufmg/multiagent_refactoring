    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.Primitives",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 5 methods (nom=5) with 4 private methods (nopm=4), indicating a small and focused class. The lines of code (loc=51) and weighted method count (wmc=23) are relatively low, suggesting manageable complexity. With no fields (nof=0) and no dependencies, this appears to be a simple utility class with sufficient modularization for its purpose."
