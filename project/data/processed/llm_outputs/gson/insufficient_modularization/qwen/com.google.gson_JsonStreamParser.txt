    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (5), low lines of code (70), and low weighted method count (6), indicating it is already well modularized. The lack of fan-in and fan-out dependencies suggests it has clear boundaries. The LCOM value of 0.6 indicates reasonable cohesion. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization based on the provided metrics."
