{
    "class": "com.google.gson.typeadapters.PostConstructAdapterFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 43 lines of code (loc=43), and weighted method count of 4 (wmc=4). The lack of fields (nof=2, all private) and simple method structure indicate proper modularization. LCOM value of 0.0 suggests good cohesion, and the class follows single responsibility principle by focusing on its specific adapter factory functionality."
