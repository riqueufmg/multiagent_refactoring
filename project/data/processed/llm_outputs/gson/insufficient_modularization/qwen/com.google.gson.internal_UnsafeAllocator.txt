    "justification": "The class has only 7 methods (nom=7) and 71 lines of code (loc=71), which is relatively small. The weighted method count (wmc=8) indicates low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.4285714285714285), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The class appears to be well-focused with a single responsibility."
