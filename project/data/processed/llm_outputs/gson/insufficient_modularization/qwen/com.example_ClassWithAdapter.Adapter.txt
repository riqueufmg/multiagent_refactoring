{
    "class": "com.example.ClassWithAdapter.Adapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 18 lines of code (loc=18). The WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 0, indicating no computational complexity. The DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree) is 1, showing no inheritance hierarchy. While the class is nested (Adapter within ClassWithAdapter), its minimal size and complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization - it appears to be a simple, well-contained adapter implementation."
