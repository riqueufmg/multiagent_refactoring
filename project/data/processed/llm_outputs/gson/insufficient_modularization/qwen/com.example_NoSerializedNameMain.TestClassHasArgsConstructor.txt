    "class": "com.example.NoSerializedNameMain.TestClassHasArgsConstructor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 field (nof=1), 1 public field (nopf=1), 0 methods (nom=0), and 6 lines of code (loc=6). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies. The class is already minimally sized and decomposed, showing no signs of insufficient modularization as it contains minimal functionality that would benefit from further decomposition."
