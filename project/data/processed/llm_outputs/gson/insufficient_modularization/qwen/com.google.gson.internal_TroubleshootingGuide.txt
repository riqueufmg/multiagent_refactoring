    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 methods (1 public) and 10 lines of code, indicating minimal size and complexity. With 0 fields and 0 dependencies, the class is already highly modularized. The low WMC (2) and absence of class dependencies suggest the class is sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
