{
    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.ProtoTypeAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 32 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 9 with only 3 public methods suggesting complex internal structure, LOC (Lines of Code) is 243 which is substantial for a single class, and it has 14 fields (NOF) with no public fields. The class also has multiple dependencies including nested classes (Builder, EnumSerialization) and various Gson types, suggesting it handles multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
