    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag.SimpleProtoOrBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and low LOC count (27). WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. The class appears to be a simple interface or builder pattern component typical in protobuf generated code, which is appropriately modularized for its purpose. No evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already minimal in scope and complexity."
