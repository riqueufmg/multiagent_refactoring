{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonAdapterAnnotationTypeAdapterFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 7 methods and WMC of 18, but LCOM of 0.0 indicates good cohesion. With only 109 lines of code and 4 fields, the class size is reasonable. The class appears to have a single, well-defined responsibility as a type adapter factory, and there's no clear indication that further decomposition would significantly reduce complexity or improve maintainability."
