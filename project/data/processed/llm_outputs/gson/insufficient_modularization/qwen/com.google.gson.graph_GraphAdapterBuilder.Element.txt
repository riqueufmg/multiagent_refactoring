    "class": "com.google.gson.graph.GraphAdapterBuilder.Element",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields and 0 methods, with a low LOC of 40. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and low complexity (wmc=0) indicates it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple data holder with minimal responsibilities."
