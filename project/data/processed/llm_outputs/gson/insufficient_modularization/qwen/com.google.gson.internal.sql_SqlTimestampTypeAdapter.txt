    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.sql.SqlTimestampTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 4 methods (nom=4), 2 fields (nof=2), and low weighted method count (wmc=5). The lines of code (loc=25) are minimal, indicating a focused, well-scoped class. The lack of inheritance (dit=1) and low lack of cohesion (lcom=0.5) suggest proper internal structure. The class appears to be a specialized adapter with a single responsibility, showing no signs of insufficient modularization."
