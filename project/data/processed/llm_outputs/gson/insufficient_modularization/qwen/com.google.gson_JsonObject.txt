    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonObject",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 20 methods with WMC of 21, which indicates moderate complexity but not excessive. LOC is 167 which is reasonable for a class handling JSON object operations. LCOM value of 0.1 suggests good cohesion. The class appears to be well-focused on its responsibility of representing JSON objects and providing related operations without clear indications of needing further decomposition."
