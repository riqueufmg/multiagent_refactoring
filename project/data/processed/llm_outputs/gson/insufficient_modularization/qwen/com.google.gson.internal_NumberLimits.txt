{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.NumberLimits",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) with 2 public methods (nopm=2), 25 lines of code (loc=25), and weighted method count of 6 (wmc=6). These metrics indicate a small, focused class with low complexity. The lack of dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple structure (nof=1, nopf=0) suggest proper modularization without need for further decomposition."
