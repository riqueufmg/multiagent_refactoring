    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.reflect.ReflectionHelper.RecordHelper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 9 lines of code (loc=9), zero methods (nom=0, nopm=0), zero fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and zero weighted method count (wmc=0). The class appears to be a minimal helper or placeholder class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. There is no evidence of complex functionality that would require further decomposition."
