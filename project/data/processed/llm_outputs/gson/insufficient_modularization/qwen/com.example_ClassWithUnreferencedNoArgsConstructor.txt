{
    "class": "com.example.ClassWithUnreferencedNoArgsConstructor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, nopm=1), 1 field (nof=1, nopf=1), and low lines of code (loc=9). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is minimal (wmc=1), indicating low implementation complexity. The Lack of Cohesion metric is 0.0, suggesting good cohesion. With only one method and one field, there is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already at a minimal, well-decomposed state."
