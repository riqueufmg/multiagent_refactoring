    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 15 fields and 551 lines of code which indicates substantial content, but without method-level metrics (0 methods, 0 WMC) it's impossible to determine if further decomposition would reduce size or complexity. The class appears to be a data holder generated from protobuf which typically doesn't require further modularization."
