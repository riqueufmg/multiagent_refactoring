```json
{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.TreeTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (117 LOC, 9 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=14). While it has 13 fields and 11 dependencies, these are necessary for its role as a type adapter in Gson framework. The low LCOM value (0.33) indicates good cohesion among methods and fields. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functionality as a tree-based type adapter that needs to handle various serialization/deserialization scenarios."
