    "class": "com.google.gson.interceptors.InterceptorFactory.InterceptorAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields (nof=2), 0 methods (nom=0, wmc=0), 21 lines of code (loc=21), and no dependencies fan-in or fan-out (fanin=0, fanout=0). The low number of fields and absence of methods indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be a simple adapter with basic structure but insufficient complexity to exhibit insufficient modularization."
