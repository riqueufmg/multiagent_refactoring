    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.NumberTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 6 methods (nom=6) and weighted method count of 10 (wmc=10), which is manageable. The lines of code (loc=42) is relatively small. The lack of fields (nof=2, nc=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggests good separation of concerns. The LCOM value of 0.5 indicates reasonable cohesion. The class appears to be well-focused on its responsibility as a type adapter for numbers without clear indications of needing further decomposition."
