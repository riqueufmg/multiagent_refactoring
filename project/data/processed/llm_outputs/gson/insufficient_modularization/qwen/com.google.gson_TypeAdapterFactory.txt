{
    "class": "com.google.gson.TypeAdapterFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), very few lines of code (loc=10), no fields (nof=0), and low complexity. The metrics indicate a highly cohesive and simple class that does not require further decomposition. The negative LCOM value (-1.0) suggests good cohesion, and the low number of dependencies (3) indicates reasonable modularity."
