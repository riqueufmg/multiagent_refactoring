    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.Streams.AppendableWriter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=4, nopf=0), and 0 weighted method count (wmc=0). The lines of code (loc=65) are reasonable for a simple writer implementation. There are no dependencies indicating tight coupling, and the lack of methods suggests it is already well-decomposed or represents a simple data structure rather than a complex class requiring further modularization."
