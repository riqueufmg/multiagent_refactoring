{
    "class": "com.google.gson.TypeAdapter.NullSafeTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 20 lines of code (loc=20). The WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity, DIT is 1 showing no inheritance depth, and fanin/fanout are both 0 indicating minimal coupling. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, its extremely small size and low complexity do not indicate insufficient modularization as it appears to be a simple, focused component."
