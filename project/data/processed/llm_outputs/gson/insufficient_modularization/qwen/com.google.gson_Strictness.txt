    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 17 lines of code, 0 methods, 0 fields, and 0 dependencies. It appears to be a simple enum or constant class that is already sufficiently modularized. No further decomposition would provide meaningful benefits in terms of reducing size or complexity."
