```json
{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 56 and LOC of 407, indicating it handles too many responsibilities. It also has 14 methods with only 5 being public, suggesting internal complexity that could be decomposed. The class has numerous dependencies (19 external classes) which indicates it is doing too much coordination work. The LCOM value of 0.357 suggests moderate cohesion issues, and with 17 fields and 14 methods, the class is large enough to benefit from further modularization to improve maintainability and reduce complexity."
