    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.TypeAdapters.IntegerFieldsTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 field (nof=1), 0 methods (nom=0), and 44 lines of code (loc=44). While the class is small, it appears to be a specialized inner class designed for a specific purpose (handling integer fields in TypeAdapters). The low complexity (wmc=0) and minimal responsibilities suggest it is appropriately modularized for its focused functionality. No evidence of insufficient modularization as the class seems properly decomposed for its intended scope."
