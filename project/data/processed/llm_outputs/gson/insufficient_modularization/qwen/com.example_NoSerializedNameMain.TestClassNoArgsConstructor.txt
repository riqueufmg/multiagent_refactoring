{
    "class": "com.example.NoSerializedNameMain.TestClassNoArgsConstructor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 field, 1 public field, 0 methods, 0 public methods, and 3 lines of code. The Weighted Methods per Class (wmc) is 0, indicating no method complexity. The Lack of Cohesion in Methods (lcom) is -1.0 which suggests either no methods or perfect cohesion. With such minimal functionality and no complex methods, there is no indication that further decomposition would provide benefits in terms of reducing size or implementation complexity."
