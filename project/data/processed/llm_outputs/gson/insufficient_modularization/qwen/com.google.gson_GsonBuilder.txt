```json
{
    "class": "com.google.gson.GsonBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 35 methods (nom=35) with 31 public methods (nopm=31), high Weighted Method Count (wmc=52), and 454 lines of code (loc=454). It also has 20 fields (nof=20) and depends on 15 other classes, indicating high complexity and responsibility. The combination of high method count, high WMC, significant lines of code, and numerous dependencies suggests the class has not been completely decomposed and could benefit from further modularization to reduce size and implementation complexity."
