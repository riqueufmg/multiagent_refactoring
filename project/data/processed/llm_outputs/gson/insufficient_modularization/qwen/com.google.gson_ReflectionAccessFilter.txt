{
    "class": "com.google.gson.ReflectionAccessFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) with 8 public methods (nopm=8), 4 fields (nof=4), and 84 lines of code (loc=84). The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 9 (wmc=9), indicating moderate complexity. While the class has multiple methods, the metrics do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The class appears to have a coherent responsibility related to reflection access filtering based on its name and dependencies."
