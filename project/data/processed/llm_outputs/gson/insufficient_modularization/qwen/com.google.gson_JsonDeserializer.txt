    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), very few lines of code (loc=16), no fields (nof=0), and minimal complexity. The low number of methods and low cyclomatic complexity indicate that the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization. The class appears to be a simple interface or minimal implementation that does not require further decomposition."
