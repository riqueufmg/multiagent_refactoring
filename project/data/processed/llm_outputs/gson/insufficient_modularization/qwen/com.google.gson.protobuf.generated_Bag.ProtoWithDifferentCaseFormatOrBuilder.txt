    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag.ProtoWithDifferentCaseFormatOrBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and low LOC (39). WMC is 0 indicating no method complexity. The class appears to be a simple interface or data structure with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition. LCOM is -1.0 which is not problematic for such a minimal class. The metrics indicate a well-modularized simple class rather than insufficiently modularized complex class."
