    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.util.ISO8601Utils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity indicators: 9 methods with WMC of 38, suggesting complex implementations. The class contains 264 lines of code which is substantial for a single class. The low LCOM value (0.222) indicates some cohesion issues. With 2 fields and 9 methods but only 4 public methods, there's a moderate level of encapsulated functionality that could potentially be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
