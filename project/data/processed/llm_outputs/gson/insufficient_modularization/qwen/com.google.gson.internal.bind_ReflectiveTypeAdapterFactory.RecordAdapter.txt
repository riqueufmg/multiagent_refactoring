{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory.RecordAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields and 0 methods, with 61 lines of code. While the LOC count is moderate, the low number of fields and methods indicates reasonable decomposition. The class appears to be a simple adapter implementation with minimal complexity (wmc=0, nc=0). There are no dependencies, suggesting good separation of concerns. The size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
