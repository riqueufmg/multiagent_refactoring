    "class": "com.example.InterfaceWithImplementation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), 14 lines of code (loc=14), and 1 field (nof=1). The low number of methods and fields indicates minimal implementation complexity that does not warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be appropriately modularized given its simple structure and low complexity metrics."
