```json
{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.MapTypeAdapterFactory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity metrics (WMC=4, NOM=3, LOF=147), single inheritance level (DIT=1), and no internal coupling issues (LCOM=0.0). The number of fields (NOF=5) and methods (NOM=3) are reasonable for a factory class. While it has several dependencies (11 external classes), this is typical for a type adapter factory in Gson framework. The class does not exhibit signs of being overly large or complex that would warrant further decomposition."
