{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.TypeAdapters",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 73 methods (nom), 69 public methods (nopm), 681 lines of code (loc), and a weighted method count of 126 (wmc). The high LCOM value of 0.9178082191780822 suggests poor cohesion, and the large number of fields (51 total, 50 public) indicates the class is managing too much responsibility. The class contains numerous type adapter implementations that could be decomposed into separate, more focused classes to reduce size and implementation complexity."
