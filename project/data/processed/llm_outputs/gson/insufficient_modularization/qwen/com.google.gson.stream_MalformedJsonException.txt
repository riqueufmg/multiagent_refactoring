    "class": "com.google.gson.stream.MalformedJsonException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3) and 15 lines of code (loc=15), which indicates a very small and simple class. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is low (wmc=3), and there are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). The class appears to be properly modularized with minimal complexity and size."
