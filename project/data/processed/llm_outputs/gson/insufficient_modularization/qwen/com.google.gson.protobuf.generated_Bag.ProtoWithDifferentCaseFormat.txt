{
    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag.ProtoWithDifferentCaseFormat",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 12 fields (nof=12) and 571 lines of code (loc=571), indicating high size and complexity. The lack of methods (nom=0, nopm=0) suggests it may be a data-heavy class that could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused modules. The high field count combined with substantial LOC suggests insufficient modularization where the class could be broken down into smaller, more manageable components."
