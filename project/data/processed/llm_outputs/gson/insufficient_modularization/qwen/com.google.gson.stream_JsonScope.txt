    "justification": "The class has very low complexity (WMC=1, NOM=1, NOF=8), minimal size (LOC=41), no dependencies, and appears to be a simple data class or utility class. The low number of methods and fields suggests it is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
