    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.Streams",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (4 methods, 4 public), low complexity (WMC=5), and reasonable size (108 LOC). The lack of class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and good cohesion (LCOM=1.0) indicate proper modularization. No evidence of insufficient decomposition based on the provided metrics."
