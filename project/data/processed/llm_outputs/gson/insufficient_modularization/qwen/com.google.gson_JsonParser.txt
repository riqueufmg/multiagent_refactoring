    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 7 methods (nom=7, nopm=7) and 84 lines of code (loc=84), which indicates a relatively small and manageable size. The weighted method count (wmc=9) is also low, suggesting low implementation complexity. With only 7 dependencies and no fields (nof=0, nopf=0), the class appears to be well-focused and adequately modularized for its responsibilities."
