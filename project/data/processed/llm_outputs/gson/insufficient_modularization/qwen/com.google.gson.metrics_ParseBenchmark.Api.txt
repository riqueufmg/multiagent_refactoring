    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 32 lines of code (loc=32). The weighted method count is 0 (wmc=0) and there are no dependencies or coupling issues (fanin=0, fanout=0, nc=0). Since the class is already minimally complex and well-contained, it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
