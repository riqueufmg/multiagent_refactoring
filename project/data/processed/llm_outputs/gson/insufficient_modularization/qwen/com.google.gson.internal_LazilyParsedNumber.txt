    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.LazilyParsedNumber",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 11 methods (nom) and WMC of 13, which is manageable. LCOM value of 0.1818181818181818 indicates good cohesion within the class. With only 68 lines of code (loc) and 1 field (nof), the class is relatively small and focused. The low number of methods and fields suggests sufficient modularization has been achieved."
