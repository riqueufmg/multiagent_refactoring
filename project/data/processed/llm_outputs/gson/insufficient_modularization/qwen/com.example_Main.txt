```json
{
    "class": "com.example.Main",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 19 methods (nom=19) and 173 lines of code (loc=173), indicating high size and complexity. It also has 13 external dependencies, suggesting it may be handling too many responsibilities. The lack of fields (nof=0) and low public method count (nopm=1) relative to total methods suggests poor internal structure. The class likely contains multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
