    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.EnumTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of fields (4), methods (4), and relatively small size (65 LOC). The weighted method count (12) indicates moderate complexity but is not excessive for this class size. The lack of inheritance (DIT=1) and low coupling (no fan-in/fan-out) suggest appropriate modularization. The class appears to be a focused adapter implementation with reasonable responsibilities."
