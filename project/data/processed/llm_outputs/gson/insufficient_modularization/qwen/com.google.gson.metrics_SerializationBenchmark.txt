    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.SerializationBenchmark",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 4 weighted method count (wmc=4), and 23 lines of code (loc=23). The lack of fields (nof=3, nc=0) and simple method structure indicate proper modularization. LCOM value of 0.666 suggests reasonable cohesion, and the small size and low complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
