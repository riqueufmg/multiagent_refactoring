{
    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 151 fields (nof=151) and 6101 lines of code (loc=6101), indicating excessive size and complexity. It also contains multiple nested classes (ProtoWithDifferentCaseFormat, ProtoWithAnnotations, Data, Type, OuterMessage, ProtoWithAnnotationsAndJsonNames, InnerMessage, SimpleProto, ProtoWithRepeatedFields) that should be decomposed into separate classes. The high LCOM value of 0.75 suggests poor cohesion, and the class has only 4 methods (nom=4) to manage this large number of fields, indicating insufficient modularization."
