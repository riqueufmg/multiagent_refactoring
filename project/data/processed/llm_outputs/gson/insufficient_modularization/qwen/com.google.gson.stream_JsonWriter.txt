{
    "class": "com.google.gson.stream.JsonWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 39 methods (nom), 81 weighted method count (wmc), 503 lines of code (loc), and only 14 fields (nof) with no public fields (nopf=0). The high method count and weighted method complexity suggest the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The low field count relative to method count indicates potential grouping of related methods into separate cohesive units."
