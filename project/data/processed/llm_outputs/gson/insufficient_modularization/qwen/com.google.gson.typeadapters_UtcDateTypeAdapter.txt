    "class": "com.google.gson.typeadapters.UtcDateTypeAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 29 which is high for a class with only 7 methods, suggesting complex method implementations. The LOC (Lines of Code) is 208 which is substantial for a single class responsibility. The class has 2 fields and 7 methods with a low LCOM (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) of 0.2857, indicating some cohesion issues. The high WMC combined with the moderate size suggests the class could benefit from decomposition to reduce implementation complexity."
