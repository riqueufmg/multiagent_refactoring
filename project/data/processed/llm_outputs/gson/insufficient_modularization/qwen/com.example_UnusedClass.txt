    "class": "com.example.UnusedClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 1 field (nof=1), and very low lines of code (loc=8). The Weighted Method Count (wmc=1) indicates minimal implementation complexity. With such low metrics across all complexity indicators, the class does not exhibit insufficient modularization as it is already sufficiently simple and decomposed."
