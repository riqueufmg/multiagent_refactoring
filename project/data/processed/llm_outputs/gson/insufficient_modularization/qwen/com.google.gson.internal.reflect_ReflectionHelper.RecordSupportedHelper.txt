    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.reflect.ReflectionHelper.RecordSupportedHelper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 fields and 0 methods, with 55 lines of code. While the LOC count is moderate, the low number of fields and methods indicates reasonable size and complexity. No metrics exceed typical thresholds for insufficient modularization (WMC=0, NOM=0, NOF=4). The class appears to be a simple helper class with appropriate cohesion."
