    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 2 fields, 0 methods, 11 lines of code, and WMC of 0. The class appears to be a simple, well-focused inner class that implements a specific constructor functionality. There is no evidence of insufficient modularization as the class is already appropriately decomposed for its minimal functionality."
