    "class": "com.google.gson.FormattingStyle",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of methods (7 total, 6 public), low complexity (WMC=9), small size (83 LOC), and no dependencies. The LCOM value of 0.0 indicates good cohesion. These metrics suggest the class is already well-decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
