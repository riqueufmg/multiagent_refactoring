    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonSerializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 method (nom=1, wmc=1), very few lines of code (loc=15), and minimal complexity. While it has 26 lines of comments (nc=26), the actual implementation is minimal and focused. The class appears to be a simple interface or abstract class that defines a serialization contract rather than a complex implementation that needs further decomposition."
