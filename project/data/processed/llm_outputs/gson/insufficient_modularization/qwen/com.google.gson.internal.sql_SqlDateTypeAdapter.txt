    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.sql.SqlDateTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 4 methods (nom=4) and weighted method count of 6 (wmc=6), which is within acceptable limits for a type adapter implementation. The lines of code (loc=45) are reasonable for a class with this responsibility. The lack of fields (nof=2, nc=0) and low LCOM value (lcom=0.75) suggest good internal cohesion. The class appears to be appropriately focused on its single responsibility as a SQL date type adapter."
