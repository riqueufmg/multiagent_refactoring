{
    "class": "com.google.gson.TypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate size (122 LOC, 10 methods) and reasonable complexity (WMC=11). While it has dependencies on 7 external classes, this is typical for a type adapter pattern that needs to interact with JSON streaming and tree structures. The lack of public fields (NOF=0, NOPF=0) and reasonable method count (NOM=10, NOPM=10) suggest appropriate encapsulation. The negative LCOM value indicates good cohesion among methods. The class appears to be appropriately modularized for its functional purpose."
