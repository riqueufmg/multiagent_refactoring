```json
{
    "class": "com.example.ClassWithJsonAdapterAnnotation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3), 3 public methods (nopm=3), and low weighted method count (wmc=3). The lines of code (loc=62) are reasonable for a class with JSON adapter annotation functionality. The lack of inheritance (dit=0) and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) suggest proper modularization. The LCOM value of 0.667 indicates some cohesion issues but is not severe enough to warrant decomposition given the overall low complexity metrics."
