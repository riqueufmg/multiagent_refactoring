{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.Excluder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: WMC (Weighted Methods per Class) is 42 which is high, NOM (Number of Methods) is 16 with 10 public methods suggesting high responsibility, and LOC (Lines of Code) is 162 which is substantial for a single class. The class has 9 fields and manages dependencies to 8 other classes, indicating it handles multiple responsibilities. Despite having LCOM of 0.0 (indicating good cohesion), the high method count and complexity suggest the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes to reduce implementation complexity."
