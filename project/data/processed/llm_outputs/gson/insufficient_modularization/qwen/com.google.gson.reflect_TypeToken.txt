    "class": "com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 64 and 22 methods (NOM), indicating it handles too many responsibilities. The LOC of 285 suggests the class is quite large for a single unit of functionality. The low LCOM value of 0.1818181818181818 indicates poor cohesion, suggesting that the class could be decomposed into smaller, more cohesive units. With only 3 fields (NOF) but 22 methods (NOM), the class appears to have a high method-to-field ratio, which often indicates insufficient modularization where related methods could be grouped into separate classes."
