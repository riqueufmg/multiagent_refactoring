```json
{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.PreJava9DateFormatProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 4 methods (nom=4) with 1 public method (nopm=1), 31 lines of code (loc=31), and weighted method count of 12 (wmc=12). These metrics indicate a relatively small and simple class that does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization. The low number of methods and moderate complexity suggest the class is appropriately decomposed for its functionality."
