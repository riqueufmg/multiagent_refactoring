```json
{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.GsonTypes",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity metrics indicating insufficient modularization: 22 methods (nom) with 13 public methods (nopm), 483 lines of code (loc), and Weighted Method Count of 80 (wmc). The high number of methods and lines of code suggest the class could benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes. The LCOM value of 0.318 indicates some cohesion issues, and the class contains only static utility methods (10 fields, 0 public fields), suggesting it could be better organized into more specialized components."
