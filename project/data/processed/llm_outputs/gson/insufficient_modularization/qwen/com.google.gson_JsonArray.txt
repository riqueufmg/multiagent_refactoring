    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonArray",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 33 methods (nom=33) with 32 public methods (nopm=32), indicating a high number of responsibilities. The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 37 (wmc=37), suggesting high complexity. With 281 lines of code (loc=281), the class is relatively large. The high number of methods and complexity suggest that further decomposition could reduce size and implementation complexity, indicating Insufficient Modularization."
