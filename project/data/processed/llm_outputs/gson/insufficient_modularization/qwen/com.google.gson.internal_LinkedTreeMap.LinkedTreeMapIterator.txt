{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.LinkedTreeMap.LinkedTreeMapIterator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 3 fields (nof=3) and 0 methods (nom=0), with a low lines of code count (loc=30). The lack of methods (wmc=0, nopm=0, nopf=0) and minimal complexity metrics indicate this is a simple iterator implementation that is appropriately modularized for its functionality. The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it appears to be a lightweight, focused component."
