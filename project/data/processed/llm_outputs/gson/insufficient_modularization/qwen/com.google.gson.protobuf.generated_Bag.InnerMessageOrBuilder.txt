    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag.InnerMessageOrBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is likely an interface or marker class rather than a complex class that needs decomposition. While LOC is 42, the lack of methods and fields suggests this is a minimal structural element rather than a case of insufficient modularization."
