{
    "class": "com.example.ClassWithJsonAdapterAnnotation.Factory",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), and only 14 lines of code (loc=14). The Weighted Method Count is 0 (wmc=0) and Depth of Inheritance Tree is 1 (dit=1), indicating minimal structural complexity. There are no dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and no class coupling (nc=0, lcom=-1.0). This suggests the class is already sufficiently decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
