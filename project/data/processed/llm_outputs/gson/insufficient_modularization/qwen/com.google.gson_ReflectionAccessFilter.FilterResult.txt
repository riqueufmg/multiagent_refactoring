    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with only 18 lines of code, 0 methods, and 0 fields. The metrics indicate minimal functionality that does not warrant further decomposition. There are no signs of insufficient modularization as the class appears to be appropriately simple and focused."
