    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.LinkedTreeMap.Node",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 9 fields and 83 lines of code, which is relatively small. It has no methods (0 nom) and no dependencies, indicating it is a simple data structure. The low number of fields and absence of complex behavior suggest it is already well-modularized and does not require further decomposition."
