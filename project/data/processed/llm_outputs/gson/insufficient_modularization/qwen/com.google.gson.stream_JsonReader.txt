```json
{
    "class": "com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 46 methods (nom=46) with 26 public methods (nopm=26), high weighted method count (wmc=329), and 1244 lines of code (loc=1244). These metrics indicate the class is large and complex, implementing substantial functionality that could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The high method count and complexity suggest insufficient modularization as the class has not been completely decomposed."
