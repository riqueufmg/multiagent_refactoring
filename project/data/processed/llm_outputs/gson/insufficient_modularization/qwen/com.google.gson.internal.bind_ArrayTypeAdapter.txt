{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.ArrayTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 4 methods and WMC of 11, but LCOM of 0.5 indicates good cohesion. With only 61 lines of code and 3 fields, the class is relatively small and manageable. The number of methods (4) and fields (3) do not indicate excessive size or complexity that would warrant further decomposition. The class appears to be well-focused on its responsibility as an array type adapter."
