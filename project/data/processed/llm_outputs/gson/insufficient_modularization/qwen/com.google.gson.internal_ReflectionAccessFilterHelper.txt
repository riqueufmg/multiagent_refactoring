    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.ReflectionAccessFilterHelper",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has moderate complexity with 8 methods (nom=8) and weighted method count of 10 (wmc=10), which is within acceptable limits for a single class. The lines of code (loc=75) is relatively small. The class has low coupling with no external dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0) and good cohesion (lcom=1.0). While it contains an inner class dependency, the overall size and complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization."
