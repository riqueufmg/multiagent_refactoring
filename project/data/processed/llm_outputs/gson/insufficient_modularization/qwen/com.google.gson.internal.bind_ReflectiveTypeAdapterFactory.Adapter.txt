    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory.Adapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 68 lines of code, 1 field, and 0 methods. The WMC is 0 indicating minimal method complexity. While the class could potentially be decomposed further, its current size and complexity are not sufficient to warrant the Insufficient Modularization smell. The class appears to be a simple adapter implementation with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
