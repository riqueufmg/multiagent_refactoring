    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonElementTypeAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high Weighted Methods per Class (WMC=29) and a large number of Lines of Code (LOC=117), indicating high complexity that could be reduced through further decomposition. The class also has a moderate Lack of Cohesion in Methods (LCOM=0.6), suggesting that the methods may not be tightly related and could benefit from being split into more cohesive modules. With 5 methods and high WMC, the class likely contains methods with complex implementations that could be broken down into smaller, more manageable components."
