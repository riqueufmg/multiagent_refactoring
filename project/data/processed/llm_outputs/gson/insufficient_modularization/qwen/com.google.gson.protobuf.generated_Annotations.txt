{
    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Annotations",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a low number of fields (5), methods (4), and lines of code (36), with a simple complexity metric (WMC=4). The LCOM value of 0.75 indicates some cohesion issues but given the small size and low complexity, further decomposition would not provide significant benefits. The class appears to be a generated class with minimal functionality that does not warrant additional modularization."
