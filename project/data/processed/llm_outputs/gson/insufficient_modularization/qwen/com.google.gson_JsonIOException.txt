    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonIOException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has low complexity with only 3 methods (nom=3, nopm=3), low lines of code (loc=21), single inheritance level (dit=1), no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), and reasonable cohesion (lcom=1.0). The class appears to be a simple exception class with minimal functionality that does not require further decomposition."
