    "class": "com.example.ClassWithJsonAdapterAnnotation.DummyClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0), 0 lines of code (loc=9 but wmc=0 suggests minimal implementation), and no dependencies. The low number of fields (nof=1) and absence of any structural complexity indicators (wmc=0, nc=0, dit=0) suggest this is a minimal class that does not require further decomposition."
