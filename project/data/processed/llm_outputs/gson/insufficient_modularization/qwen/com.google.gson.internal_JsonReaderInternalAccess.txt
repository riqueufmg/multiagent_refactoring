    "justification": "The class has minimal complexity with only 1 method (nom=1), 10 lines of code (loc=10), and Weighted Methods per Class of 1 (wmc=1). It contains only 1 field (nof=1) and has no complex dependencies or high coupling indicators. The low size and complexity metrics do not suggest insufficient modularization."
