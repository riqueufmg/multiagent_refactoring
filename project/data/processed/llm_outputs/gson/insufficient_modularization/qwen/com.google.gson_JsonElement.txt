    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonElement",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 23 methods (nom=23, nopm=23) and 227 lines of code (loc=227), indicating a large and complex class that could benefit from further decomposition. The high number of methods suggests multiple responsibilities that should be separated into smaller, more focused classes. The WMC metric of 27 also indicates high complexity that could be reduced through better modularization."
