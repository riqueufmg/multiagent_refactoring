    "class": "com.google.gson.FieldAttributes",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 9 methods (nom=9) and 70 lines of code (loc=70), which represents a moderate size. The Weighted Method Count (wmc=9) indicates low complexity. With only 1 field (nof=1) and no class dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), this appears to be a simple, well-encapsulated class with focused responsibilities. The low LCOM value (0.0) suggests good cohesion among the methods and the single field. The class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it maintains a reasonable size and complexity level."
