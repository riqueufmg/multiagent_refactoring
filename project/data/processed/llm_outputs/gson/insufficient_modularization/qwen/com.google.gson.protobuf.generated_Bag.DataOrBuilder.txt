    "justification": "The class has 0 methods (nom=0, nopm=0) and 0 fields (nof=0, nopf=0), indicating it is likely an interface or marker class with minimal functionality. With only 37 lines of code (loc=37) and no complexity (wmc=0), the class does not exhibit signs of insufficient modularization as it is already highly simplified and decomposed."
