    "class": "com.google.gson.Gson.FutureTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has very low complexity with 0 methods (nom), 0 weighted method count (wmc), and only 29 lines of code (loc). It has minimal responsibilities with only 1 field (nof) and no public fields (nopf). The low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and simple inheritance depth (dit=2) indicate proper modularization. The class appears to be a simple, well-encapsulated type adapter implementation without excessive complexity that would warrant further decomposition."
