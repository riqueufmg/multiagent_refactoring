    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonTreeWriter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has 23 methods (nom) with 42 weighted method count (wmc), indicating high complexity. The large number of methods (23) and high WMC (42) suggest the class could benefit from decomposition to reduce size and implementation complexity. With 179 lines of code (loc) and 5 fields (nof), the class contains substantial functionality that could be better modularized."
