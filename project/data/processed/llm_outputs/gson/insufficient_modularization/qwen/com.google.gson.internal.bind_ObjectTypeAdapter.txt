{
    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.ObjectTypeAdapter",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The class has high complexity with WMC of 28 and 8 methods, indicating it handles too many responsibilities. The LOC of 119 suggests the class is doing too much work for a single unit of functionality. The class has 3 fields and 8 methods with only 4 private methods, suggesting poor encapsulation and potential for decomposition. The high number of dependencies (9) indicates the class is tightly coupled to many external components, which could be reduced through better modularization."
