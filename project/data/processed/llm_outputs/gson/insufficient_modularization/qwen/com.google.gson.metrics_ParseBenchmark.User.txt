    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.ParseBenchmark.User",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 36 lines of code and 38 LOC, which is relatively small. It has 0 methods (nom: 0, wmc: 0) indicating it may be a simple data class or placeholder. The lack of methods and low complexity metrics do not indicate insufficient modularization - rather, the class appears to be appropriately simple. No further decomposition is warranted based on the metrics provided."
