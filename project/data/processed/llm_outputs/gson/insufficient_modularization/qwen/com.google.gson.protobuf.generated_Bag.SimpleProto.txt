    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag.SimpleProto",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 12 fields and 472 lines of code which indicates substantial complexity, but without method-level metrics (WMC=0, NOM=0) and with only self-dependency, there is insufficient evidence to determine if further decomposition would be beneficial. The class appears to be a generated protobuf class which typically should not be manually refactored."
