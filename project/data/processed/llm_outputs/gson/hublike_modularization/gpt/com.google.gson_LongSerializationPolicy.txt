    "detection": false,
    "justification": "LongSerializationPolicy has only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.gson.JsonNull, com.google.gson.JsonElement) and only 2 incoming dependents (com.google.gson.Gson, com.google.gson.GsonBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; the observed counts are small, so this is not a hub."
