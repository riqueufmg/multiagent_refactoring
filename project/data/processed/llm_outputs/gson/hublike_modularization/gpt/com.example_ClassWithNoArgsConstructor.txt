    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.example.Main). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming AND outgoing connections; this class does not exhibit a large number of dependencies in either direction. Although com.example.Main depends on many classes, that does not make this class a hub."
