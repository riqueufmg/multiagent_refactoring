    "class": "com.google.gson.GsonBuilder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "GsonBuilder has a high number of outgoing dependencies (15): ReflectionAccessFilter, Gson, Strictness, LongSerializationPolicy, FieldNamingStrategy, FieldNamingPolicy, TypeToken, ToNumberStrategy, SqlTypesSupport, DefaultDateTypeAdapter, FormattingStyle, ExclusionStrategy, Excluder, TreeTypeAdapter, TypeAdapterFactory. It also has multiple incoming dependencies (4) from different clients/packages: com.google.gson.Gson, com.google.gson.graph.GraphAdapterBuilder, com.example.NoSerializedNameMain, com.example.Main. Notably there is bidirectional coupling with com.google.gson.Gson (GsonBuilder -> Gson and Gson -> GsonBuilder). The combination of many outgoing links to internal factories/adapters/strategies and multiple incoming clients across packages indicates the class acts as a central hub, matching the Hub-like Modularization smell."
