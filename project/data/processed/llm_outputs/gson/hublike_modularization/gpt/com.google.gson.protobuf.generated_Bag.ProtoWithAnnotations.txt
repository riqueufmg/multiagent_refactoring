    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag) and only one incoming dependency source listed (com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag). Both incoming and outgoing dependency counts are 1, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization (which requires dependencies with a large number of other abstractions)."
