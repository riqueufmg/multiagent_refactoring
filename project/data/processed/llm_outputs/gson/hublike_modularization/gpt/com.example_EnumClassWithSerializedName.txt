    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 0 (outgoing_dependencies is empty). Incoming dependencies: 1 (only com.example.Main references this class). Although Main's dependency list contains many entries (13 total, including EnumClassWithSerializedName), the analyzed class has no outgoing links and only a single incoming client. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that condition."
