    "justification": "FormattingStyle has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 3 incoming dependencies (com.google.gson.Gson, com.google.gson.GsonBuilder, com.google.gson.stream.JsonWriter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; FormattingStyle does not meet this criterion."
