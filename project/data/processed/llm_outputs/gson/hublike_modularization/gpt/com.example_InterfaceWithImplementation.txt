    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.example.Main). Although com.example.Main lists many dependencies, InterfaceWithImplementation itself is directly connected to only a single other abstraction (Main). Therefore it does not exhibit hub-like modularization (not connected to a large number of other abstractions)."
