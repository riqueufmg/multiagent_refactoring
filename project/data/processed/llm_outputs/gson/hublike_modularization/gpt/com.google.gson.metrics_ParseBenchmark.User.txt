    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.ParseBenchmark.User",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies and only a single incoming dependency (com.google.gson.metrics.ParseBenchmark). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and/or outgoing). Here incoming count = 1 and outgoing count = 0, so it does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
