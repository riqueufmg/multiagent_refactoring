    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies (empty dependency list) and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.gson.protobuf.ProtoTypeAdapter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships; this class does not exhibit a large number of either. Although the incoming class (ProtoTypeAdapter) depends on many types, the analyzed class itself lacks numerous incoming/outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
