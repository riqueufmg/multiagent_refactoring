    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonIOException",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies (no outgoing links) and 3 incoming dependencies (com.google.gson.JsonParser, com.google.gson.Gson, com.google.gson.internal.reflect.ReflectionHelper). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; JsonIOException has incoming references but no outgoing dependencies, so it does not qualify as a hub."
