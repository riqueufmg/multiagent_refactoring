    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.ParseBenchmark.Document",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has only one outgoing dependency (com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken) and only one incoming dependency (referenced by com.google.gson.metrics.ParseBenchmark). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies; those counts are low here. Note: com.google.gson.metrics.ParseBenchmark depends on many classes, but that makes ParseBenchmark a hub candidate, not ParseBenchmark.Document."
