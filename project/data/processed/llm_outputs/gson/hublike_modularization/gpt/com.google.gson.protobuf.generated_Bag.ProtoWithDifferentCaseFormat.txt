    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag) and only 1 incoming dependency (referenced by com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not exhibit that pattern."
