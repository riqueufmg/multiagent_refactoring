    "justification": "com.example.ClassWithHasArgsConstructor has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.example.Main). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships. Although com.example.Main references many classes, the analyzed class itself is referenced by a single class and has no outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
