    "justification": "No incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty), and only 4 direct outgoing dependencies: com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader, com.google.gson.metrics.BagOfPrimitives, com.google.gson.Gson, com.google.gson.metrics.NonUploadingCaliperRunner. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and outgoing ties; this class lacks incoming ties and has a small set of direct outgoing dependencies, so it is not a hub."
