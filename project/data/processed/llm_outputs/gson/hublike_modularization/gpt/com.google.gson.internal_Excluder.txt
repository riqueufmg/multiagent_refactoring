    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.Excluder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "Excluder has outgoing dependencies to 8 distinct abstractions (com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader, com.google.gson.stream.JsonWriter, com.google.gson.Gson, com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken, com.google.gson.internal.reflect.ReflectionHelper, com.google.gson.TypeAdapter, com.google.gson.ExclusionStrategy, com.google.gson.FieldAttributes) and is referenced by 3 other abstractions (com.google.gson.Gson, com.google.gson.GsonBuilder, com.google.gson.internal.bind.ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory). Notably, com.google.gson.Gson appears both in outgoing and incoming lists (mutual coupling). Several of the connected classes (Gson, TypeAdapter, JsonReader/JsonWriter, TypeToken) are core types that themselves have extensive dependency sets, indicating Excluder sits at a nexus of many relationships. These characteristics (many incoming and outgoing ties, including mutual dependency with a central class) match the Hub-like Modularization smell."
