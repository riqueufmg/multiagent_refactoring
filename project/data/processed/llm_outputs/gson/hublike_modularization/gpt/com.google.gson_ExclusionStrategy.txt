    "justification": "ExclusionStrategy has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.gson.FieldAttributes) and only 2 incoming dependencies (com.google.gson.GsonBuilder and com.google.gson.internal.Excluder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions on both incoming and outgoing sides; the provided data shows low counts, so the smell is not present."
