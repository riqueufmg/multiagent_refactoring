    "justification": "Not detected: the class has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.gson.internal.ObjectConstructor) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions, which is not the case here."
