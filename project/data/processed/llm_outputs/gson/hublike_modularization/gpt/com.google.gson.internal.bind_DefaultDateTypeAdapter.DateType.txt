    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.gson.internal.bind.DefaultDateTypeAdapter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here outgoing_dependencies = [] and incoming count = 1, so it is not a hub."
