    "class": "com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "TypeToken is heavily referenced (high incoming fan-in) — 30 distinct classes reference it (including com.google.gson.Gson, com.google.gson.GsonBuilder, com.google.gson.internal.bind.TypeAdapters, ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory, ArrayTypeAdapter, MapTypeAdapterFactory, etc.). However, its outgoing dependencies are minimal (only 2: com.google.gson.internal.GsonTypes and com.google.gson.internal.TroubleshootingGuide). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here only the incoming side is large, so the class does not meet the hub-like modularization smell."
