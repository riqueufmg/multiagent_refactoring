    "justification": "InterceptorFactory has outgoing dependencies to 4 other abstractions (com.google.gson.Gson, com.google.gson.interceptors.JsonPostDeserializer, com.google.gson.TypeAdapter, com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken) but has no incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; here the incoming degree is zero and the outgoing degree is small, so it is not a hub."
