    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag.OuterMessage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "OuterMessage has only one outgoing dependency (com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag) and only one incoming dependent (com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here the class interacts only with a single other abstraction, so the smell is not present."
