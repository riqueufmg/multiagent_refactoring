    "class": "com.google.gson.typeadapters.PostConstructAdapterFactory.PostConstructAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.gson.TypeAdapter) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class does not meet that criterion. Note: the listed TypeAdapter has multiple dependencies, but those are dependencies of TypeAdapter, not incoming/outgoing links of the analyzed class."
