    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonDeserializationContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 2 incoming dependencies (com.google.gson.JsonDeserializer, com.google.gson.protobuf.ProtoTypeAdapter) and 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.gson.JsonParseException, com.google.gson.JsonElement). These small numbers indicate it is not connected to a large number of other abstractions, so it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization. Note: although one outgoing dependency (com.google.gson.JsonElement) itself references many classes, that does not increase the direct incoming/outgoing degree of JsonDeserializationContext."
