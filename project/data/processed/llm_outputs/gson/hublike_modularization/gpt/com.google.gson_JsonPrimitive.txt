    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonPrimitive",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "JsonPrimitive has multiple incoming dependencies (5 distinct classes reference it: com.google.gson.JsonObject, com.google.gson.JsonElement, com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonTreeReader, com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonTreeWriter, com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonElementTypeAdapter) but only a single outgoing dependency (com.google.gson.internal.NumberLimits). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both a large number of incoming and a large number of outgoing dependencies. Because JsonPrimitive has many incoming but only one outgoing dependency, it does not meet the definition of a hub-like module."
