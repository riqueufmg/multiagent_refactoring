    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonArray",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like modularization is characterized by an abstraction having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions both incoming and outgoing. com.google.gson.JsonArray has 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.gson.JsonNull, com.google.gson.JsonElement) and 6 incoming dependencies (com.google.gson.JsonObject, com.google.gson.JsonElement, com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonTreeReader, com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonTreeWriter, com.google.gson.extras.examples.rawcollections.RawCollectionsExample, com.google.gson.protobuf.ProtoTypeAdapter). These dependencies are primarily among closely related JSON types and a few related readers/writers/adapters rather than a large, broad set of unrelated abstractions. Therefore, based on the provided data, JsonArray does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
