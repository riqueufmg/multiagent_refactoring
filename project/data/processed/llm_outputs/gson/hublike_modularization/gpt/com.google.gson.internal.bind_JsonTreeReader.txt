    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonTreeReader",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "JsonTreeReader has 5 outgoing dependencies (com.google.gson.JsonElement, com.google.gson.JsonObject, com.google.gson.JsonPrimitive, com.google.gson.JsonArray, com.google.gson.stream.JsonToken) and only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.gson.TypeAdapter). Because the number of distinct incoming dependents is low (1) and the outgoing set is modest (5), it does not exhibit the hub-like modularization smell (not a central hub with large numbers of both incoming and outgoing connections)."
