    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.gson.internal.LinkedTreeMap). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion."
