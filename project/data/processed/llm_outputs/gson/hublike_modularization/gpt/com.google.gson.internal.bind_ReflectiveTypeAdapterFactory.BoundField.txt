    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies for the class are empty (outgoing_dependencies: []). There is a single incoming dependency entry (from com.google.gson.internal.bind.ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory). A hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; this class has zero outgoing dependencies and only one incoming dependency, so it does not meet the hub-like criteria."
