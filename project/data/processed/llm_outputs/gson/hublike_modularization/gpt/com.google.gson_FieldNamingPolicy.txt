    "justification": "FieldNamingPolicy has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies (from com.google.gson.Gson and com.google.gson.GsonBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the outgoing dependency count is zero and the incoming count is small, so the hub-like smell is not present."
