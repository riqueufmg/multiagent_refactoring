    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.ParseBenchmark.GsonBindParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty) and only a single direct outgoing dependency (com.google.gson.Gson). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the referenced com.google.gson.Gson entry lists many of its own dependencies, the analyzed class itself only depends on one abstraction and therefore does not meet the 'large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies' condition."
