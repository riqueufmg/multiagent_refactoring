    "justification": "FieldAttributes has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 2 incoming dependencies (referenced by com.google.gson.ExclusionStrategy and com.google.gson.internal.Excluder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (high fan-in and/or fan-out). With a fan-in of 2 and fan-out of 0, this class does not meet the criteria for a hub."
