    "class": "com.google.gson.Gson.FutureTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency (com.google.gson.TypeAdapter) and only one incoming dependency (com.google.gson.Gson). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and many outgoing). The provided data shows a single incoming and a single outgoing dependency, so the hub-like smell is not present."
