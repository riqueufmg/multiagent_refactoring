    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag.ProtoWithRepeatedFieldsOrBuilder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. Although the outgoing_dependencies section shows that Bag (a different class) depends on many other types, the analyzed class itself does not exhibit many incoming or outgoing links, so the smell is not detected."
