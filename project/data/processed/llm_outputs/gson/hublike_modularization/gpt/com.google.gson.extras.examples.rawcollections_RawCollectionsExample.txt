    "class": "com.google.gson.extras.examples.rawcollections.RawCollectionsExample",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "No. The class has zero incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies = []). It has only four direct outgoing dependencies: RawCollectionsExample.Event, Gson, JsonArray, and JsonParser. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; here incoming is empty and the number of direct outgoing dependencies (4) is not large. Note: although the outgoing dependency entry for Gson lists many of Gson's own dependencies, those are not direct incoming links to RawCollectionsExample — RawCollectionsExample directly depends on the single abstraction Gson."
