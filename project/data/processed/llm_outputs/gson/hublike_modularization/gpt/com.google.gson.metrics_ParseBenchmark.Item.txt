    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.ParseBenchmark.Item",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 incoming dependencies and 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; since both dependency counts are zero, the smell is not present when analyzing this class in isolation."
