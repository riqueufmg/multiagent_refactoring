    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.NonUploadingCaliperRunner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "NonUploadingCaliperRunner has 0 outgoing dependencies (no dependencies listed) and 4 incoming dependencies (referenced by SerializationBenchmark, BagOfPrimitivesDeserializationBenchmark, ParseBenchmark, CollectionsDeserializationBenchmark). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here outgoing dependencies are absent and the incoming count (4) is not accompanied by outgoing links, so the class is not a hub."
