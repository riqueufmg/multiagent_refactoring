    "class": "com.google.gson.stream.JsonToken",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "JsonToken is referenced by a large number of other classes (28 incoming references, e.g. com.google.gson.Gson, com.google.gson.JsonParser, com.google.gson.TypeAdapter, com.google.gson.internal.Streams, com.google.gson.internal.bind.TypeAdapters, com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader, various TypeAdapter implementations and factories). However, JsonToken has zero outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty). The Hub-like Modularization smell requires an abstraction to have many dependencies in both directions (both many incoming and many outgoing). Because JsonToken has many incoming but no outgoing dependencies, it does not meet the definition of Hub-like Modularization."
