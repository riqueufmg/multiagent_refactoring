    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 6 abstractions (com.google.gson.stream.JsonWriter, com.google.gson.JsonElement, com.google.gson.JsonObject, com.google.gson.JsonNull, com.google.gson.JsonPrimitive, com.google.gson.JsonArray). Incoming dependencies: 2 abstractions (com.google.gson.TypeAdapter, com.google.gson.Gson). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. Although JsonTreeWriter has several outgoing dependencies, it has only two incoming dependencies in the provided data, so it does not meet the criterion of having a large number of both incoming and outgoing relationships."
