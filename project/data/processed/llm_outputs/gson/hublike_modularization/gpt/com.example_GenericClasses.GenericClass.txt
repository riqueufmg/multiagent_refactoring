    "class": "com.example.GenericClasses.GenericClass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only a single incoming source: com.example.GenericClasses (incoming_dependencies contains one entry). The incoming entry lists only two referenced names (com.example.GenericClasses.DummyClass and com.example.GenericClasses.GenericClass) and there is only one distinct incoming abstraction. Because the class lacks both a large number of incoming and outgoing connections and only has a single incoming dependent, it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
