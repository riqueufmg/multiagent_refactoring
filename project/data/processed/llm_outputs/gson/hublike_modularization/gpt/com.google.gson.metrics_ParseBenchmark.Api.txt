    "justification": "Not detected: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.gson.metrics.ParseBenchmark). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; neither many incoming nor many outgoing connections are present here."
