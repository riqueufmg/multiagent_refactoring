    "justification": "UtcDateTypeAdapter has outgoing dependencies to 3 abstractions (com.google.gson.stream.JsonWriter, com.google.gson.stream.JsonToken, com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader) and has 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have both many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Because incoming_dependencies = 0 and outgoing count is small (3), the smell is not detected."
