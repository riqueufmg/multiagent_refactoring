    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The analyzed class has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. Although com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag (an outgoing dependency) itself lists many dependencies, the analyzed class does not have a large number of incoming or outgoing relations, so the hub-like smell is not present."
