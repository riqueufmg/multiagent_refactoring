    "justification": "JsonPostDeserializer has no outgoing dependencies (empty list) and only two incoming dependents: com.google.gson.interceptors.InterceptorFactory and com.google.gson.interceptors.InterceptorFactory.InterceptorAdapter. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the outgoing count is zero and the incoming count is small, so this is not a hub."
