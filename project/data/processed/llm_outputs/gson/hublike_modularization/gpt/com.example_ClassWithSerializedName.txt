    "class": "com.example.ClassWithSerializedName",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and only 1 incoming abstraction (com.example.Main) listed in incoming_dependencies. Although Main depends on many classes, ClassWithSerializedName itself is referenced by a single incoming class and has no outgoing links, so it does not exhibit many incoming and outgoing dependencies required for Hub-like Modularization."
