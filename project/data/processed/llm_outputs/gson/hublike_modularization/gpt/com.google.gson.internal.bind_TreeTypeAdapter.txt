    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 11 distinct abstractions (TreeTypeAdapter.GsonContextImpl, JsonDeserializer, JsonReader, Gson, JsonElement, TypeToken, JsonWriter, Streams, TypeAdapter, JsonSerializer, TypeAdapterFactory). Incoming dependencies: only 2 abstractions (com.google.gson.GsonBuilder and com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonAdapterAnnotationTypeAdapterFactory) reference TreeTypeAdapter. Because hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies, TreeTypeAdapter does not qualify — it has many outgoing ties but very few incoming ties."
