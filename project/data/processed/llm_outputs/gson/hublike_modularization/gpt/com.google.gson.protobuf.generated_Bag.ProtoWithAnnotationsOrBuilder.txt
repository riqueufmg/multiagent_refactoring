    "justification": "The class has only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; this class does not exhibit a large number of connections. Note: although the outgoing target 'Bag' has many dependencies, the analyzed class itself does not have many incoming or outgoing links."
