    "class": "com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag.ProtoWithRepeatedFields",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency: com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag, and only one incoming dependency entry (from com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag). Although that Bag entry lists many related classes, the analyzed class itself has incoming and outgoing relationships with a single other abstraction (Bag), not a large number of distinct abstractions required for a hub-like modularization smell."
