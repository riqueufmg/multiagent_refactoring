    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.gson.ReflectionAccessFilter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies with a large number of other abstractions (many incoming and/or outgoing). Given the empty outgoing_dependencies and a single incoming reference, this class does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
