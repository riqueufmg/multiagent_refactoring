    "justification": "FieldNamingStrategy has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 3 incoming dependencies (referenced by com.google.gson.Gson, com.google.gson.GsonBuilder, and com.google.gson.internal.bind.ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory). It does not exhibit dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions, so it is not a hub-like modularization."
