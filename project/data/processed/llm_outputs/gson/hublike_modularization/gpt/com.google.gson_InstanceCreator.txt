    "justification": "The class has 3 incoming dependencies (com.google.gson.internal.ConstructorConstructor, com.google.gson.internal.ConstructorConstructor.InstanceCreatorConstructor, com.google.gson.graph.GraphAdapterBuilder) and 0 outgoing dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming AND many outgoing dependencies; because outgoing dependencies are absent, the smell is not detected."
