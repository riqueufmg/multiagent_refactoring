    "justification": "JsonScope has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies both incoming and outgoing with a large number of other abstractions; JsonScope does not meet this (incoming_count=1, outgoing_count=0), so the smell is not detected."
