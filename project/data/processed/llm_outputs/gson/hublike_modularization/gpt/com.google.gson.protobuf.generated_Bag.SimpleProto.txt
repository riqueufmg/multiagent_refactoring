    "justification": "Not a hub: the class has a single outgoing dependency (com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag) and a single incoming dependency (from com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here incoming count = 1 and outgoing count = 1, so the smell is not present."
