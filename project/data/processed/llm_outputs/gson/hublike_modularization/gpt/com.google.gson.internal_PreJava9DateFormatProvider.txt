    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.PreJava9DateFormatProvider",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.gson.internal.bind.DefaultDateTypeAdapter). A hub-like modularization would require dependencies (incoming and/or outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions; here PreJava9DateFormatProvider is referenced by a single class and does not depend on other classes, so it does not exhibit the smell."
