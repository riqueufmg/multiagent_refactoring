    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.UnsafeAllocator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Considering the class in isolation, UnsafeAllocator has only one outgoing dependency (com.google.gson.internal.ConstructorConstructor) and only one incoming dependency (com.google.gson.internal.ConstructorConstructor). Because the number of distinct incoming and outgoing dependencies is low (1 each), this does not meet the hub-like modularization smell criterion of having dependencies with a large number of other abstractions."
