    "justification": "EnumSerialization has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.gson.protobuf.ProtoTypeAdapter). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing links with other abstractions; this class does not meet that criterion (incoming count = 1, outgoing count = 0)."
