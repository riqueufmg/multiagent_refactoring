    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []). It has only 1 incoming dependency source: com.google.gson.metrics.ParseBenchmark (incoming_dependencies contains a single entry). Although that incoming source lists many dependencies, Tweet itself does not have both a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships. Therefore it does not exhibit Hub-like Modularization."
