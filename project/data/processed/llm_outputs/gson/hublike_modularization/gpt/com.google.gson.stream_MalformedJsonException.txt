    "detection": false,
    "justification": "MalformedJsonException is not a hub: it has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; the provided data shows only a single incoming reference and no outgoing references, so the smell is not present."
