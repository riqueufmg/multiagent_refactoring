    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies. RuntimeTypeAdapterFactory has multiple outgoing dependencies (7): com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader, com.google.gson.stream.JsonWriter, com.google.gson.Gson, com.google.gson.JsonElement, com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken, com.google.gson.JsonObject, com.google.gson.TypeAdapter. However, it has no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies is empty). Because it lacks the required large number of incoming dependencies, it is not a hub-like module."
