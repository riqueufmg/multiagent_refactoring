    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonDeserializer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "JsonDeserializer has a small number of direct relationships: 3 outgoing dependencies (com.google.gson.JsonParseException, com.google.gson.JsonElement, com.google.gson.JsonDeserializationContext) and 3 incoming dependents (com.google.gson.internal.bind.TreeTypeAdapter, com.google.gson.internal.bind.TreeTypeAdapter.SingleTypeFactory, com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonAdapterAnnotationTypeAdapterFactory). These counts are not indicative of a hub that connects to a large number of other abstractions. Although some related classes (e.g., JsonElement, TreeTypeAdapter) list many dependencies themselves, by the constraint to consider JsonDeserializer in isolation its direct incoming/outgoing degree is low, so it is not a hub-like modularization."
