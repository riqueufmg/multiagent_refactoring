    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.SerializationDelegatingTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "SerializationDelegatingTypeAdapter has only one direct outgoing dependency (com.google.gson.TypeAdapter) and no incoming dependencies. Although the referenced TypeAdapter depends on multiple other abstractions (JsonWriter, JsonReader, JsonElement, Streams, JsonTreeWriter, JsonTreeReader, JsonToken), SerializationDelegatingTypeAdapter itself does not have a large number of incoming and outgoing relationships and therefore does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
