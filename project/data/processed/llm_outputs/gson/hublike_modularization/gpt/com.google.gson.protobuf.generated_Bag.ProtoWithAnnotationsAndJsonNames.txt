    "justification": "The class has only one outgoing dependency: com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag (from analyzed_package.dependencies). The only incoming dependency shown is also from com.google.gson.protobuf.generated.Bag (Bag lists ProtoWithAnnotationsAndJsonNames among its dependencies). Hub-like Modularization requires many incoming and outgoing connections to a large number of other abstractions; here both incoming and outgoing counts are 1, so this class is not a hub."
