    "justification": "TypeAdapterFactory has many incoming dependencies (15 distinct classes: Gson, GsonBuilder, SqlTypesSupport, SqlDateTypeAdapter, SqlTimestampTypeAdapter, SqlTimeTypeAdapter, EnumTypeAdapter, ArrayTypeAdapter, TreeTypeAdapter, NumberTypeAdapter, DefaultDateTypeAdapter, JsonAdapterAnnotationTypeAdapterFactory, TypeAdapters, ObjectTypeAdapter, JavaTimeTypeAdapters) but only 3 outgoing dependencies (Gson, TypeAdapter, TypeToken). Hub-like Modularization requires a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; here the outgoing fan-out is small, so the hub-like smell is not detected."
