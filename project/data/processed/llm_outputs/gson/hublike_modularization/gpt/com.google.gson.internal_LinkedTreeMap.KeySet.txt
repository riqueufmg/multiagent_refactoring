    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.LinkedTreeMap.KeySet",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 0 outgoing dependencies and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.gson.internal.LinkedTreeMap, which lists KeySet among its related types). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows incoming_count=1 and outgoing_count=0, so the criterion is not met."
