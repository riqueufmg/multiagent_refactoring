    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.bind.ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory.RecordAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies length = 0) and no incoming dependencies (incoming_dependencies length = 0). The analyzed_package.dependencies array is also empty. Because Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing relationships, the absence of any dependencies means this class is not exhibiting the hub-like modularization smell."
