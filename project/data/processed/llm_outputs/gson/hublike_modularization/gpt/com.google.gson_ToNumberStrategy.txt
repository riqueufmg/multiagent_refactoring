    "justification": "Outgoing dependencies: 1 (com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader). Incoming dependencies: 4 classes (com.google.gson.Gson, com.google.gson.GsonBuilder, com.google.gson.internal.bind.NumberTypeAdapter, com.google.gson.internal.bind.ObjectTypeAdapter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. With only 1 outgoing and 4 incoming dependencies (both counts are low), this class does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."
