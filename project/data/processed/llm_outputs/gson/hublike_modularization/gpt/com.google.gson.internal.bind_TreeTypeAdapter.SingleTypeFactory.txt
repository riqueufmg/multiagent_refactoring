    "justification": "Not detected: the class has outgoing dependencies to three abstractions (com.google.gson.JsonDeserializer, com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken, com.google.gson.JsonSerializer) but has zero incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies; the absence of incoming dependencies means this class is not a hub."
