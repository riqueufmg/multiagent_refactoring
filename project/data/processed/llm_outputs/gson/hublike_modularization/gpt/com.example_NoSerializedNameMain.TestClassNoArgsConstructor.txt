    "justification": "The class is not a hub. It has no outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies is empty) and is referenced by only one other class (one entry in incoming_dependencies: com.example.NoSerializedNameMain). Hub-like modularization requires many incoming and outgoing connections; here outgoing = 0 and incoming dependents = 1, so the smell is not present."
