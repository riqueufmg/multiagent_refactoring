    "justification": "TestExecutor has no outgoing dependencies (empty outgoing_dependencies) and only a single incoming dependency (referenced by com.example.Main). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; here TestExecutor lacks outgoing connections and has only one incoming reference (listed in Main's dependencies), so it is not a hub."
