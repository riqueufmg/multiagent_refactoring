    "justification": "JsonSyntaxException has zero outgoing dependencies (empty list) and only two incoming dependencies (from com.google.gson.JsonParser and com.google.gson.Gson). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing dependencies; here outgoing count = 0 and incoming count = 2, so it does not qualify as a hub."
