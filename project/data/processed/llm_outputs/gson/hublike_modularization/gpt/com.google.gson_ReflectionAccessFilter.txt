    "class": "com.google.gson.ReflectionAccessFilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "ReflectionAccessFilter has a small number of relationships: outgoing dependencies to com.google.gson.internal.ReflectionAccessFilterHelper and com.google.gson.ReflectionAccessFilter.FilterResult (2 outgoing), and a single incoming dependency from com.google.gson.GsonBuilder (1 incoming). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows only 1 incoming and 2 outgoing dependencies, so the smell is not present."
