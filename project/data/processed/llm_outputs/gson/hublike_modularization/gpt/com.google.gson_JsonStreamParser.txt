    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonStreamParser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have a large number of both incoming and outgoing dependencies. com.google.gson.JsonStreamParser has outgoing dependencies to 6 distinct abstractions: com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader, com.google.gson.JsonElement, com.google.gson.Strictness, com.google.gson.internal.Streams, com.google.gson.JsonParseException, com.google.gson.stream.JsonToken, but has 0 incoming dependencies. Because there are no incoming dependencies, the class does not exhibit hub-like modularization."
