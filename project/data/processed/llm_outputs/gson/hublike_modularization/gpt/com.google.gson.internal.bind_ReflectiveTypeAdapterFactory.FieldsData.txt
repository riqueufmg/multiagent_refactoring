    "justification": "Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. The analyzed class has 0 outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies: []) and only 1 incoming dependency (from com.google.gson.internal.bind.ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory). Counts: incoming=1, outgoing=0. Therefore it does not meet the 'hub-like' criteria."
