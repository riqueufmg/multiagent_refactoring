    "justification": "Not detected: the class has zero outgoing dependencies (outgoing_dependencies = []) and only a single incoming dependency (only com.google.gson.internal.bind.TypeAdapters references it). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; FactorySupplier has neither. (Note: the TypeAdapters class lists many dependencies, but those are dependencies of the caller, not outgoing dependencies of FactorySupplier.)"
