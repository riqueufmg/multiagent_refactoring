    "class": "com.google.gson.internal.sql.SqlTimestampTypeAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a small number of outgoing dependencies (6: com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader, com.google.gson.stream.JsonWriter, com.google.gson.Gson, com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken, com.google.gson.TypeAdapter, com.google.gson.TypeAdapterFactory) and only one incoming dependency (1: com.google.gson.internal.sql.SqlTypesSupport). Hub-like modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing connections; here both incoming and outgoing counts are low and the outgoing dependencies are expected framework types for a TypeAdapter, so this is not a hub."
