    "justification": "JsonSerializer has only 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.gson.JsonSerializationContext, com.google.gson.JsonElement) and 3 incoming dependents (com.google.gson.internal.bind.TreeTypeAdapter, com.google.gson.internal.bind.TreeTypeAdapter.SingleTypeFactory, com.google.gson.internal.bind.JsonAdapterAnnotationTypeAdapterFactory), for a total of 5 directly connected abstractions. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction with many incoming and outgoing connections; these counts are low. Analysis is limited to the class in isolation and does not count transitive connections of its neighbors."
