    "justification": "Not detected. The class has a small number of direct relationships: 2 outgoing dependencies (com.google.gson.JsonElement, com.google.gson.TypeAdapter) and only 1 incoming dependency (com.google.gson.graph.GraphAdapterBuilder). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and many outgoing dependencies; these counts are low. (Although the outgoing targets themselves have many dependencies, the analysis of this class in isolation shows it is not a hub.)"
