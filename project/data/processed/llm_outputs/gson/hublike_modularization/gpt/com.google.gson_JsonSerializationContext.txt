    "class": "com.google.gson.JsonSerializationContext",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has a very small interaction surface: only 1 outgoing dependency (com.google.gson.JsonElement) and only 2 incoming dependents (com.google.gson.JsonSerializer and com.google.gson.protobuf.ProtoTypeAdapter). Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have incoming and outgoing dependencies with a large number of other abstractions; the provided data shows low counts, so the smell is not detected."
