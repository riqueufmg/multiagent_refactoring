    "class": "com.google.gson.interceptors.InterceptorFactory.InterceptorAdapter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies and only two direct outgoing dependencies: com.google.gson.interceptors.JsonPostDeserializer and com.google.gson.TypeAdapter. Although TypeAdapter itself lists several dependencies, InterceptorAdapter interacts directly with only these two abstractions, which is not a large number and therefore does not qualify as hub-like modularization."
