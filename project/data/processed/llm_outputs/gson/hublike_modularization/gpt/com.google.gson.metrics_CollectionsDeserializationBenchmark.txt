    "class": "com.google.gson.metrics.CollectionsDeserializationBenchmark",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The class has 5 outgoing dependencies (com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader, com.google.gson.Gson, com.google.gson.metrics.NonUploadingCaliperRunner, com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken, com.google.gson.metrics.BagOfPrimitives) and 0 incoming dependencies. Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have many incoming and outgoing connections; here there are no incoming dependencies and the number of direct outgoing dependencies is small. (Note: one outgoing dependency, com.google.gson.Gson, itself references many types, but that does not make the analyzed class a hub because it lacks numerous incoming relations and only has a limited set of direct outgoing links.)"
