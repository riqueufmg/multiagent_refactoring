"justification": "The package com.google.gson.internal.reflect has outgoing dependencies to com.google.gson.internal and com.google.gson. Both of these packages have higher stability (more classes, larger LOC, higher Ca) than the analyzed package, which aligns with the Stable Dependencies Principle. There is no evidence of dependency on less stable packages."
