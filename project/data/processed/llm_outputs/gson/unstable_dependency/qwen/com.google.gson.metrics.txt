"package": "com.google.gson.metrics",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package com.google.gson.metrics has outgoing dependencies to com.google.gson.stream, com.google.gson, and com.google.gson.reflect. All these dependencies are more stable than the metrics package (they have higher Ca values and lower Ce values), following the Stable Dependencies Principle. The metrics package itself has no incoming dependencies (Ca=0), making it unstable but it doesn't depend on less stable packages."
