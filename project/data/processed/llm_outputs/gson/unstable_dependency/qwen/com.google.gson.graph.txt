All these dependencies have higher stability (Ca/(Ca+Ce)) than 'com.google.gson.graph' which has stability of 0 (Ca=0, Ce=4). 'com.google.gson.stream' has stability 0.8, 'com.google.gson.internal' has stability 0.54, 'com.google.gson' has stability 0.71, and 'com.google.gson.reflect' has stability 0.9. Since all dependencies are more stable than the analyzed package, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
