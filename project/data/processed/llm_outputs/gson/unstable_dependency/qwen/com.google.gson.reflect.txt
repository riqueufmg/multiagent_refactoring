"justification": "The package 'com.google.gson.reflect' has outgoing dependencies only to 'com.google.gson.internal', which has a higher stability (Ca=6, Ce=5, Stability=0.545) compared to itself (Ca=9, Ce=1, Stability=0.1). This adheres to the Stable Dependencies Principle as it depends on a more stable package. No unstable dependencies are detected."
