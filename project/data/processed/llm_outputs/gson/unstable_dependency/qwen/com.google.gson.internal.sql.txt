"justification": "The package com.google.gson.internal.sql has outgoing dependencies to com.google.gson.stream, com.google.gson, and com.google.gson.reflect. To evaluate stability, we compare the instability (I = Ce / (Ca + Ce)) of the analyzed package against its dependencies. The analyzed package has instability I = 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75. The dependencies have the following instabilities: com.google.gson.stream (I = 2 / (8 + 2) = 0.2), com.google.gson (I = 5 / (12 + 5) = 0.29), and com.google.gson.reflect (I = 1 / (9 + 1) = 0.1). All dependencies are more stable (lower instability) than the analyzed package, which aligns with the Stable Dependencies Principle. Therefore, there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
