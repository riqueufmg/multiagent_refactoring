"justification": "The package 'com.google.gson.internal' depends on 'com.google.gson.internal.bind' which has a lower stability (0.75) compared to itself (0.45). This violates the Stable Dependencies Principle, as 'com.google.gson.internal' is more stable and should not depend on less stable packages."
