"detection": false,
"justification": "The package com.google.gson.internal.bind.util has stability value of 0 (Ce=0, Ca=1, so I = 1, instability = Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 0/1 = 0). It depends on no other packages (Ce=0). The only incoming dependency is from com.google.gson.internal.bind which has higher instability value (Ce=6, Ca=2, instability = 6/8 = 0.75). Since this package is completely stable (instability=0) and doesn't depend on any other packages, it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle."
