"package": "com.google.gson.stream",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'com.google.gson.stream' has outgoing dependencies to 'com.google.gson.internal' and 'com.google.gson'. Both of these packages have higher stability (more incoming dependencies and/or less volatility) than 'com.google.gson.stream', which aligns with the Stable Dependencies Principle. There is no evidence that 'com.google.gson.stream' depends on less stable packages."
