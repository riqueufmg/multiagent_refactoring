"detection": false,
"justification": "The package com.google.gson.typeadapters has outgoing dependencies to com.google.gson.stream, com.google.gson, and com.google.gson.reflect. To determine if this creates an unstable dependency, we need to calculate stability (I = Ce/(Ca+Ce)) for each package. com.google.gson.typeadapters has I = 3/(0+3) = 1.0 (maximally unstable). com.google.gson.stream has I = 2/(8+2) = 0.2, com.google.gson has I = 5/(12+5) = 0.29, and com.google.gson.reflect has I = 1/(9+1) = 0.1. Since com.google.gson.typeadapters (I=1.0) depends on packages that are more stable (lower instability values 0.2, 0.29, 0.1), it follows the Stable Dependencies Principle and does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
