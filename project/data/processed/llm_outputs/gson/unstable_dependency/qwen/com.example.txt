"package": "com.example",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package com.example has no incoming dependencies (Ca=0) and only outgoing dependencies to com.google.gson and com.google.gson.reflect. Since com.example does not have any dependents, the Stable Dependencies Principle does not apply. The package com.example is at the root of the dependency chain and therefore cannot exhibit unstable dependency smell."
