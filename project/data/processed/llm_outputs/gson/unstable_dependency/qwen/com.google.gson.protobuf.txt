"package": "com.google.gson.protobuf",

"justification": "The package com.google.gson.protobuf has stability value of 1.0 (Ce=1, Ca=0), while its dependency com.google.gson has stability value of 0.29 (Ce=5, Ca=12). Since the dependent package com.google.gson is more stable than the analyzed package com.google.gson.protobuf, this follows the Stable Dependencies Principle and does not constitute an Unstable Dependency smell."
