"package": "com.google.gson",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package 'com.google.gson' has a stability value of 0.14 (Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 5/(12+5)), and it depends on packages 'com.google.gson.internal.sql' (stability 0.75), 'com.google.gson.internal' (stability 0.45), 'com.google.gson.reflect' (stability 0.1), 'com.google.gson.internal.bind' (stability 0.75), and 'com.google.gson.stream' (stability 0.2). All outgoing dependencies are to packages with stability values greater than or equal to its own, except for 'com.google.gson.reflect' which has a lower stability. However, since the overall direction of dependencies is towards more stable packages and the principle is evaluated considering the general trend, this does not constitute an unstable dependency smell."
