"package": "com.google.gson.internal.bind",
"detection": true,
"justification": "The package 'com.google.gson.internal.bind' depends on 'com.google.gson' which has a higher instability value (0.29) compared to its own instability value (0.75). According to the Stable Dependencies Principle, a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself. Since this rule is violated, it indicates an Unstable Dependency smell."
