"package": "com.google.gson.interceptors",
"detection": false,
"justification": "The package com.google.gson.interceptors has no incoming dependencies (Ca=0) and depends on three packages: com.google.gson.stream (I=2/(2+8)=0.2), com.google.gson (I=5/(5+12)=0.294), and com.google.gson.reflect (I=1/(1+9)=0.1). All these dependencies have lower instability values than com.google.gson.interceptors (I=3/(3+0)=1.0), meaning the package depends on more stable packages as required by the Stable Dependencies Principle."
