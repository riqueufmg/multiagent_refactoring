"detection": false,
"justification": "com.google.gson.typeadapters has Ce=3 and Ca=0 (instability I = Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 3/(0+3) = 1.0), making it highly unstable; however all of its outgoing dependencies are more stable: com.google.gson (Ce=5, Ca=12, I=5/17 ≈ 0.294), com.google.gson.stream (Ce=2, Ca=8, I=2/10 = 0.2), com.google.gson.reflect (Ce=1, Ca=9, I=1/10 = 0.1). Since the package depends only on packages with lower instability (more stable) and has no incoming dependencies (Ca=0), the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell detected."
