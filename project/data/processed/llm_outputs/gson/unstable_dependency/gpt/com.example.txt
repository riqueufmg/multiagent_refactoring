  "package": "com.example",

  "justification": "com.example has Ce=2, Ca=0 (instability I = 2/(2+0) = 1.0). Its outgoing dependencies: com.google.gson (Ce=5, Ca=12, I = 5/(5+12) = 0.294) and com.google.gson.reflect (Ce=1, Ca=9, I = 1/(1+9) = 0.100). Both outgoing packages have lower instability (are more stable) than com.example, so the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected and there is no Unstable Dependency smell."
