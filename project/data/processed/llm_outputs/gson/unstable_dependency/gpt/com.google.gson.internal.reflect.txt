"justification": "Analyzed package instability I = Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 2/(2+2) = 0.50. Outgoing dependency com.google.gson: I = 5/(12+5) ≈ 0.294 (more stable than 0.50). Outgoing dependency com.google.gson.internal: I = 5/(6+5) ≈ 0.455 (more stable than 0.50). Both outgoing dependencies have lower instability than the analyzed package, so the package does not depend on less stable components. Incoming dependency com.google.gson.internal.bind has I = 6/(6+2) = 0.75 (more unstable) but this is an incoming relation and does not cause the analyzed package to violate the Stable Dependencies Principle."
