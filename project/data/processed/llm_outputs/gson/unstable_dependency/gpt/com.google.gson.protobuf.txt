"justification": "com.google.gson.protobuf has Ce=1 and Ca=0 (stability I = 0/(0+1) = 0.0). Its sole outgoing dependency is com.google.gson which has Ce=5 and Ca=12 (stability I = 12/(12+5) ≈ 0.7059). Incoming dependencies to com.google.gson.protobuf = 0. Because the dependency (com.google.gson) is more stable than com.google.gson.protobuf, the Stable Dependencies Principle is respected and no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
