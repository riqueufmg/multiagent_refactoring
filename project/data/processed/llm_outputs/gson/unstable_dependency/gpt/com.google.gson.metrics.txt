"justification": "Analyzed package metrics: Ce=3, Ca=0 -> Stability S_pkg = 3/(3+0) = 1.0 (highly unstable). Outgoing dependencies and their stabilities: com.google.gson (Ce=5, Ca=12 -> S=5/(5+12)=0.294), com.google.gson.stream (Ce=2, Ca=8 -> S=0.2), com.google.gson.reflect (Ce=1, Ca=9 -> S=0.1). The Stable Dependencies Principle requires a package to depend only on packages more stable than itself (lower S). All outgoing dependencies have substantially lower S (are more stable) than com.google.gson.metrics. Although com.google.gson.metrics has Ca=0 (making it inherently unstable), it does not depend on less stable packages. Therefore no Unstable Dependency smell is detected."
