"justification": "The analyzed package has Ce=1 and Ca=0 => instability I = 1.0 (very unstable). Its only outgoing dependency is com.google.gson with Ce=5 and Ca=12 => instability I ≈ 0.294 (more stable). Since the package depends on a more stable package (I_dependent > I_dependency) and has no incoming dependencies, it does not violate the Stable Dependencies Principle; therefore Unstable Dependency is not detected."
