"justification": "The package has Ce=0 (no outgoing dependencies) and Ca=1 (one incoming dependency), yielding stability I = 1.0. It does not depend on any other packages, so it cannot depend on less stable components. The only referenced package is com.google.gson.internal.bind (incoming, Ce=6, Ca=2), which depends on this util package rather than the util depending on it. Therefore Unstable Dependency is not present."
