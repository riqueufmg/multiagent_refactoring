"package": "com.google.gson.interceptors",

"justification": "com.google.gson.interceptors has Ce=3 and Ca=0 => instability I = 0/(0+3) = 0.0 (completely unstable). Its outgoing dependencies are: com.google.gson (Ce=5, Ca=12 => I = 12/(12+5) = 0.7059), com.google.gson.stream (Ce=2, Ca=8 => I = 8/(8+2) = 0.8), and com.google.gson.reflect (Ce=1, Ca=9 => I = 9/(9+1) = 0.9). All dependent packages have higher stability indices than com.google.gson.interceptors, and there are no incoming dependencies (Ca=0). Therefore the package does not depend on less stable components and does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell."
