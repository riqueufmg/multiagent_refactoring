"package": "com.google.gson.stream",
"detection": true,
"justification": "com.google.gson.stream has Ce=2 and Ca=8 (stability S = 8/(8+2) = 0.80). Its outgoing dependencies are: com.google.gson (Ce=5, Ca=12, S = 12/(12+5) ≈ 0.706) and com.google.gson.internal (Ce=5, Ca=6, S = 6/(6+5) ≈ 0.545). Both outgoing dependencies have lower stability than com.google.gson.stream, so com.google.gson.stream depends on less stable components, violating the Stable Dependencies Principle. Incoming dependency metrics (Ca=8) also indicate com.google.gson.stream is relatively stable, reinforcing that depending on the less stable packages above constitutes an Unstable Dependency smell."
