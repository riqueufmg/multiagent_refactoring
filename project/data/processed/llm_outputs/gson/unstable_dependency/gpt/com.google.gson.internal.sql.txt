"package": "com.google.gson.internal.sql",

"justification": "Target instability I = Ce/(Ce+Ca) = 3/(3+1) = 0.75 (unstable). Outgoing dependencies: com.google.gson I = 5/(5+12) ≈ 0.294, com.google.gson.stream I = 2/(2+8) = 0.20, com.google.gson.reflect I = 1/(1+9) = 0.10. All outgoing dependencies have lower instability (are more stable) than com.google.gson.internal.sql, so the package does not depend on less stable components and thus does not exhibit the Unstable Dependency smell. Note: com.google.gson (I ≈ 0.294) depends on this package (I = 0.75), which means a more stable package depends on a less stable one and may be a risk, but per the given definition the smell (depending on less stable components) is not present for com.google.gson.internal.sql."
