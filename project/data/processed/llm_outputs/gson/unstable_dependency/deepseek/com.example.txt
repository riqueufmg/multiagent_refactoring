  "justification": "The analyzed package has instability I=1.0 (Ce=2, Ca=0) and depends on packages with lower instability: com.google.gson.reflect (I=0.1, Ce=1, Ca=9) and com.google.gson (I≈0.294, Ce=5, Ca=12). Since all dependencies point to more stable packages, the Stable Dependencies Principle is satisfied."
