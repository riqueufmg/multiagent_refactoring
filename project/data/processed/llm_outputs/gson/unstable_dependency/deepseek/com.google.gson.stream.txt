"justification": "The package's instability (I = Ce/(Ca+Ce) = 2/(8+2) = 0.2) is lower than the instability of its outgoing dependencies: com.google.gson (I = 5/(12+5) ≈ 0.29) and com.google.gson.internal (I = 5/(6+5) ≈ 0.45). This means the package is more stable than the packages it depends on, which follows the Stable Dependencies Principle."
