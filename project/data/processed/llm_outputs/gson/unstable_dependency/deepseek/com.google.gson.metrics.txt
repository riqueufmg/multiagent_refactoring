  "package": "com.google.gson.metrics",

  "justification": "The analyzed package has instability index 1.0 (Ce=3, Ca=0). All its outgoing dependencies have lower instability indices: com.google.gson.stream (0.2), com.google.gson (~0.294), and com.google.gson.reflect (0.1). Since all dependencies are more stable (lower instability index) than the analyzed package, the Stable Dependencies Principle is not violated."
