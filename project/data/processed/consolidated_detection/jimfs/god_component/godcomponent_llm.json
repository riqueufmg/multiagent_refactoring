        "justification": "The package contains 92 classes and 8,457 LOC, indicating a very large component. Several individual classes are themselves large and complex (e.g., JimfsFileChannel: 553 LOC, WMC 52; FileSystemView: 546 LOC, WMC 84; RegularFile: 467 LOC, WMC 81; AttributeService: 292 LOC, WMC 63; JimfsPath: 279 LOC, WMC 71; Directory: 267 LOC, WMC 49; File: 226 LOC, WMC 42). Many classes have high method counts and complexity (high WMC and NOM), and the package hosts numerous responsibilities and inner types. Taken together (high total LOC, high class count, multiple very large/complex classes) this indicates an excessively large component consistent with the God Component smell."
