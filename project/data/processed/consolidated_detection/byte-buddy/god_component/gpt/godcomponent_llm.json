Many classes are relatively large and complex (numerous jmhTest classes with ~275 LOC and WMC=42 repeated across the package), giving an average of ~186 LOC per class and a concentration of complexity in multiple files. Additionally, the package has no external afferent/emanent couplings (Ca=0, Ce=0), suggesting the functionality is self-contained rather than split across modules. These elements (high total LOC, large number of classes, multiple high-complexity/large classes) support detecting a God Component smell for this package."

The package also has Ce=7 (it depends on many external packages) and Ca=0 (no incoming dependencies), suggesting the package is relatively self-contained yet large.
