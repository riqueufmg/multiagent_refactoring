The Weighted Methods per Class metric is 26 (wmc=26), suggesting high complexity. With 280 lines of code (loc=280) and only 1 field (nof=1), this class concentrates too many regex utility operations in a single class rather than being decomposed into smaller, more focused classes. The high method count and complexity suggest insufficient modularization where related methods could be grouped into separate specialized classes."
