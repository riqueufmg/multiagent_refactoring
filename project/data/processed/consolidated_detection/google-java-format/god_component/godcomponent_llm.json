        "justification": "The package contains 10 classes totaling 381 LOC which is moderate rather than excessive. Responsibilities are distributed across multiple focused classes (e.g., GoogleJavaFormatFormattingService LOC 70, GoogleJavaFormatConfigurable LOC 73, GoogleJavaFormatSettings LOC 60, JreConfigurationChecker LOC 50, import optimizer LOC 43) and several very small utility/state classes (LOC 1–33). No single class dominates the package in LOC or complexity (largest class 73 LOC, WMC up to 14). Coupling is low (Ca = 0, Ce = 1) and classes have limited fan-in/fan-out, indicating responsibilities are separated. Based on this distribution and the provided metrics, there is no clear evidence that this package is an excessively large God Component."

Several individual classes are very large and centralize complexity (e.g., JavaInputAstVisitor: 3,233 LOC, 167 methods, WMC 560 — ~40% of package LOC; JavaInput: 474 LOC, WMC 64; StringWrapper: 328 LOC, WMC 46; ImportOrderer: 370 LOC, WMC 54; JavaOutput: 277 LOC, WMC 63). The package contains many big classes and nested types, high method counts and complexity concentrated in a few components, which matches the God Component smell (a component excessively large in LOC and number of classes)."

        "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 102 LOC (classes of ~49 and ~53 LOC), so it is small in both number of classes and lines of code. Class metrics show moderate complexity (WMC 8 and 9) and low coupling (fanin 0, fanout 0; Ca=0, Ce=1). Given the limited size and low coupling, there is insufficient evidence to consider this package a God Component."

Those two classes alone account for ~42% of the package LOC. Additional mid-sized classes (Newlines 159 LOC, Input 115 LOC) exist, but the presence of very large classes with many responsibilities and high complexity (many methods, high WMC, nested types inside Doc) indicates that functionality is centralized in a small number of oversized components, consistent with the God Component smell."

These two classes alone account for the majority of the package LOC and exhibit high complexity and large method counts, indicating that the package centralizes substantial responsibilities related to Javadoc lexing/formatting. The combination of total LOC, number of classes and the presence of several very large/complex classes supports identifying this package as a God Component."
