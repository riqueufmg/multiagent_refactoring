The class JavaInputAstVisitor alone has 3233 lines of code and 167 methods, contributing significantly to the overall size and complexity.

Neither of the classes shows indicators of being overly complex or handling too many responsibilities.

While the package has a considerable number of classes and lines of code, the classes are logically grouped around the core functionality of code formatting. Key classes like Doc (536 LOC), OpsBuilder (504 LOC), and Newlines (159 LOC) are large but appear to encapsulate distinct responsibilities. There is no single class or component that overwhelmingly centralizes the logic or operations of the system. The distribution of responsibilities across multiple cohesive classes indicates a well-structured design rather than a God Component."

The largest classes (JavadocLexer with 375 LOC and JavadocWriter with 247 LOC) are specialized components with clear responsibilities. The package exhibits good internal structure and modularity without a single dominant component."
