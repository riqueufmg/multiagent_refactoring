All of these packages have higher Ca (afferent couplings) and similar or higher stability (lower instability index) compared to the hotthrow package, indicating they are more stable. The hotthrow package does not depend on any less stable packages, thus adhering to the Stable Dependencies Principle."

Since the analyzed package is more unstable than the package it depends on, it follows the Stable Dependencies Principle. No unstable dependency smell is detected."
