The very high LOC, method counts and complexity metrics for these classes indicate excessive size and likely multiple responsibilities concentrated in a small number of components.

A single file (LinkedTreeMap) also defines multiple nested types (Node, Iterator, EntrySet, KeySet), increasing class/count density in one component.
