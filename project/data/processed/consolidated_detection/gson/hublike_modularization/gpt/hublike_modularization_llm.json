Hub-like Modularization requires an abstraction to have dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions. With only 1 outgoing and 4 incoming dependencies (both counts are low), this class does not meet the criteria for a hub-like module."

        "justification": "The class has no incoming dependencies and only two direct outgoing dependencies: com.google.gson.interceptors.JsonPostDeserializer and com.google.gson.TypeAdapter. Although TypeAdapter itself lists several dependencies, InterceptorAdapter interacts directly with only these two abstractions, which is not a large number and therefore does not qualify as hub-like modularization."
