It also depends on a wide set of collaborators (14 distinct dependencies) indicating multiple responsibilities are being handled inside this single class. Although LCOM=0.0 suggests internal cohesion, the combination of high size, high complexity, many methods, and many external dependencies supports that the class could be further decomposed to reduce size and implementation complexity."
