A God Component is characterized by an excessively large size (many classes or very high LOC); this package does not exhibit that, and its incoming/outgoing coupling (Ca=3, Ce=3) is modest, so there is insufficient evidence to label it a God Component."

The extreme LOC concentration and high class complexity indicate the package's functionality is dominated by a single, excessively large class, supporting detection of a God Component."

Although one class (SupplementalInfoRetriever) is relatively large (121 LOC, WMC 25, NOM 8) and accounts for ~45% of the package LOC—indicating a localized risk of a God Class—the overall package size and class count do not justify labeling the entire package as a God Component.

A few classes hold most of the code and complexity rather than responsibilities being evenly distributed, indicating an excessive size/complexity concentrated in a small number of classes. These factors (high LOC concentration, large method counts, and high WMC in the key classes) support identifying this package as exhibiting the God Component smell."
