There is a single larger utility class (FileFilterUtils: 469 LOC, 43 methods) but it appears to be an aggregator/helper rather than evidence the entire package centralizes unrelated functionality.

Several other large classes (FilenameUtils 928 LOC, FileSystem 433 LOC, EndianUtils 355 LOC, DirectoryWalker 261 LOC) further concentrate functionality.
