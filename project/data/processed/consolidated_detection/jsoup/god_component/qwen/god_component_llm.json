The class 'Connection' alone comprises 772 lines of code and has a high number of methods (43), indicating it encapsulates excessive functionality. Additionally, the 'Jsoup' class, with 269 lines of code and 24 methods, acts as a facade managing dependencies to multiple other classes such as 'Safelist', 'HttpConnection', 'Parser', 'Document', and 'Cleaner', suggesting centralization of system operations. These factors indicate that the package and its key classes are excessively large and承担过多职责, qualifying as a God Component."
