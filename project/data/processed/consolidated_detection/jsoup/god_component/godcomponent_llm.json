Several individual classes are extremely large and complex (Element: 1,571 LOC, WMC 241, nom 157; Node: 766 LOC, WMC 139, nom 79; Attributes: 522 LOC, WMC 99, nom 48; Document: 447 LOC). Multiple other classes exceed typical single-class sizes (Range 202 LOC, Entities 299 LOC, Printer 176 LOC). High class sizes and high WMC values, combined with many cross-dependencies within the package, indicate concentrated responsibilities and complexity consistent with a God Component."

Several classes are disproportionately large and complex: org.jsoup.internal.StringUtil (322 LOC, 26 methods, WMC 50) and org.jsoup.internal.ControllableInputStream (169 LOC, 17 methods, WMC 34) and org.jsoup.internal.SimpleBufferedInput (120 LOC, 11 methods, WMC 34). StringUtil in particular touches many subsystems (parser, nodes, helper classes) indicating mixed responsibilities and high cognitive load. The package also has multiple external dependencies, suggesting it is a central utility hub. These factors (high package LOC concentrated in a few complex classes, many methods and high complexity metrics, and wide dependency reach) support diagnosing a God Component."

The package also shows substantial coupling (Ce=8, Ca=8) and many dependencies to other internal packages, indicating centralized, highly connected functionality. This concentration of code, methods, and complexity in a few large classes supports detection of a God Component at the package level."

Multiple classes also show high method counts and complexity (e.g. HttpConnection.nom=48, DataUtil.nom=19, W3CDom.nom=18), and the package mixes diverse responsibilities (HTTP connection handling, response processing, data utilities, DOM conversion, validation).

The largest class (HtmlToPlainText) is 96 LOC — notable but not excessively large. Complexity metrics are modest (maximum WMC = 8), and class-level coupling (fanin/fanout = 0) is low. Package-level coupling (Ca = 4, Ce = 4) is moderate and does not indicate a single overwhelmingly central component. Based on class count, overall LOC, and modest complexity/coupling, there is insufficient evidence to classify this package as a God Component."

Numerous inner classes for different evaluation behaviours and high method/complexity metrics on core classes show the package handles parsing, querying, traversal and selection logic rather than a single cohesive responsibility, consistent with a God Component smell."

Safelist also defines several inner types (TagName, AttributeKey, AttributeValue, Protocol, TypedValue) indicating multiple responsibilities bundled into a single large class. The next largest class (Cleaner) is 133 LOC, substantially smaller. The concentration of size, methods and inner types in Safelist supports that a single component is excessively large relative to the package, consistent with the God Component smell."

Multiple classes have very high cyclomatic complexity (WMC values up to 473/409) and large numbers of methods, showing concentrated responsibility and complexity inside this package. These facts (high total LOC, many very large/complex classes, and concentrated functionality) support the detection of a God Component in org.jsoup.parser."
