      "detection": true,
      "justification": "This class is large (loc=322) with many methods (nom=24) and very high complexity (wmc=40). It declares multiple fields (nof=7) and has several responsibilities (byte array buffering, conversions, input-stream construction) and dependencies (Charsets, IOUtils, ClosedInputStream). Compared to the package average size (~90 LOC/class), its size and complexity indicate concentrated responsibilities and mixed concerns, suggesting it would benefit from decomposition."

      "class": "DeferredFileOutputStream",
      "detection": true,
      "justification": "Large implementation (loc=322) with many methods (nom=19), high complexity (wmc=25) and a large number of fields (nof=12). Its low cohesion indicator (lcom=0.1579) combined with dependencies spanning byte-array output abstractions and file utilities (AbstractByteArrayOutputStream, ByteArrayOutputStream, PathUtils) implies it mixes buffering, file-switching and file-management concerns — a sign of insufficient modularization."

      "class": "LockableFileWriter",
      "detection": true,
      "justification": "Very large (loc=327) with many methods (nom=22) and high complexity (wmc=28). It handles both file-writing logic and locking/locking-related build/origin concerns (dependencies include AbstractByteArrayOutputStream, FileUtils, build.AbstractOrigin). Its size and breadth of dependencies and responsibilities (I/O, lock management, builder) point to a class that bundles multiple concerns and would benefit from splitting responsibilities."

      "class": "WriterOutputStream",
      "detection": true,
      "justification": "Substantially large (loc=278) with many methods (nom=17) and high complexity (wmc=26). It deals with charset decoding, buffering and stream-to-writer translation (dependencies: Charsets, CharsetDecoders, IOUtils) and contains a builder. The combination of size, complexity and the multiple distinct responsibilities related to encoding, decoding and streaming suggests insufficient modularization."

    {
      "class": "ProxyWriter",
      "detection": false,
      "justification": "Although sizeable (loc=194, nom=14), ProxyWriter's role is a delegation/proxy abstraction. Its complexity reflects forwarding methods rather than mixed domain responsibilities. The class focuses on a single, well-defined concern (proxying/wrapping a Writer) and therefore does not exhibit the multi-responsibility fragmentation characteristic of insufficient modularization."
    },
    {
      "class": "ProxyOutputStream",
      "detection": false,
      "justification": "Similar to ProxyWriter, ProxyOutputStream (loc=188, nom=15) primarily delegates to an underlying OutputStream. Its higher method count is due to interface forwarding; it encapsulates a single responsibility (proxying) rather than multiple, unrelated concerns, so it is not a clear case of insufficient modularization."

    {
      "class": "XmlStreamWriter",
      "detection": false,
      "justification": "XmlStreamWriter is moderately large (loc=193, nom=13, wmc=24) but its responsibilities are focused on XML stream formatting/serialization (uses XmlStreamReader, IOUtils and a Builder). Its cohesion (lcom≈0.385) and dependency set indicate related functionality within the XML-writing domain rather than an accumulation of unrelated concerns, so it appears cohesive enough and not a prime example of insufficient modularization."
