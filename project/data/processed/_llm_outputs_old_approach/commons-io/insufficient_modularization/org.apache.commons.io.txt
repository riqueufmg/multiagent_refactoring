The class exposes a very large API surface and concentrates many I/O utilities that could be split into smaller, more focused helpers (e.g., byte/char utilities, streams, readers/writers), indicating insufficient decomposition."

The size and broad set of file-related operations suggest multiple responsibilities (file traversal, copying, deletion, path handling, etc.) that are candidates for modularization into cohesive components."

The high complexity and sizable API suggest the class may bundle multiple concerns (different path formats, case handling, integration with filesystem strategies) that could be separated to improve cohesion."
