The class has multiple dependencies (FileUtils, FileTimes, SerializableFileTime) suggesting it handles both file metadata and related operations. The combination of high LOC, many methods and fields indicates responsibilities that could be further decomposed."

It depends on multiple collaborators (comparators, file filters, Builder, FileEntry, FileUtils, IOCase) and likely mixes traversal, detection logic and listener management. The concentration of many responsibilities and high complexity suggests insufficient modularization."
