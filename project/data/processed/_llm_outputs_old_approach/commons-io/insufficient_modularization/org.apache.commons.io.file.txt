It depends on many other types and contains nested utility types, indicating multiple responsibilities (path manipulation, copying, deletion, traversal helpers) concentrated in one class rather than separated concerns. Moderate cohesion (lcom=0.651) plus the breadth of functionality suggests it should be decomposed into smaller, focused abstractions."

      "justification": "Substantial size and surface area (loc=563, nom=57, wmc=57) for a utility-like class. The large number of methods and complexity indicate a bloated interface that likely mixes multiple behaviors (wrapping checked IO operations, many convenience overloads). This concentration of many operations in one class signals insufficient modularization."

Lower cohesion (lcom=0.35) and high complexity compared with other visitors suggest it mixes concerns that could be split (separate counting strategy, traversal logic, and builder/configuration)."

The class groups a single cohesive concept (counters) with clear subtypes rather than multiple unrelated responsibilities, so it appears intentionally organized rather than insufficiently modularized."
