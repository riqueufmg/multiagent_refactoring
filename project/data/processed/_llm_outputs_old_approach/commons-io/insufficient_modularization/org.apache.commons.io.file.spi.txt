      "justification": "The class is small (56 LOC) with a modest number of methods (6) and a moderate cyclomatic/weight metric (WMC=7). It has only 3 fields and no incoming or outgoing package-level dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating it does not act as a large, centralized hub of responsibilities. Although LCOM=0.833 suggests some cohesion concerns, the overall size and complexity are low, so there is insufficient evidence that the class is excessively large or aggregating multiple distinct responsibilities that would indicate Insufficient Modularization."
