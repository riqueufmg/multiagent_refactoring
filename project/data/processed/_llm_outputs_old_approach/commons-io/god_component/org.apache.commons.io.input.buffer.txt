    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.io.input.buffer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and a total of 343 LOC, which is modest in size for a package. Although CircularByteBuffer is the largest class (196 LOC, WMC 34, 13 methods) and accounts for ~57% of the package LOC, the package as a whole is not excessively large in terms of number of classes or total LOC. Coupling is low (Ce=1, Ca=0) and the other classes are small (98 LOC and 49 LOC). Given the provided data and without broader project context, this package does not meet the contextual criteria for a God Component."
