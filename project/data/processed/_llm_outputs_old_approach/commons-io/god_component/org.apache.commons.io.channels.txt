    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.io.channels",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 4 classes and 458 LOC in total, which is not excessively large in context. The largest class (ByteArraySeekableByteChannel) is 202 LOC with 18 methods and WMC 33 — sizeable but not overwhelmingly dominant relative to the package. Other classes are 118, 99, and 39 LOC. Coupling indicators are low (Ca=0, Ce=2) and there is no indication of extreme concentration of functionality or unusually high class count. Based on these metrics, the component does not exhibit the excessive size characterizing a God Component."
