    "justification": "The package org.apache.commons.io.input is excessively large: 101 classes and 10,353 LOC. The package contains many very large classes (examples: Tailer 683 LOC, XmlStreamReader 541 LOC, ReadAheadInputStream 401 LOC, ReversedLinesFileReader 375 LOC, BoundedInputStream 327 LOC, UnsynchronizedBufferedReader 327 LOC, ProxyInputStream 249 LOC, CharSequenceInputStream 237 LOC, NullInputStream 238 LOC), plus numerous inner/builder classes, indicating concentrated and substantial implementation. The afferent/efferent coupling (Ca=5, Ce=8) suggests this size is due to internal volume rather than external distribution. These elements collectively support detecting a God Component in this package."
