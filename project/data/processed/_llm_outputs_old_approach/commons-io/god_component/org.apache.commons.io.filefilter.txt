    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.io.filefilter",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "Although the package contains 32 classes and 2,709 LOC, the work is distributed among many small, focused classes (many under ~130 LOC) implementing individual file filters. Coupling is low (Ce=5, Ca=3, fanin/fanout mostly 0) and classes exhibit targeted responsibilities (low/narrow nc, modest WMC for most). There is a single larger utility class (FileFilterUtils: 469 LOC, 43 methods) but it appears to be an aggregator/helper rather than evidence the entire package centralizes unrelated functionality. Overall the package structure and metrics indicate cohesion and modularity rather than an excessively large God Component."
