    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes and a total of 579 LOC, which is moderate in size and not excessive for a small utility package. Although ValidatingObjectInputStream is relatively large (278 LOC, nom=17, wmc=19) and could be a candidate for class-level refactoring, the remainder of the classes are small (LOC 11–123, most under ~25 LOC). The class count (7) is low and the package LOC is not overwhelmingly large, so the package as a whole does not qualify as a \"God Component.\""
