    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.io.file.spi",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class and 56 LOC, which is small and not indicative of an excessively large component. Class-level metrics (nof=3, nom=6, wmc=7) show modest complexity, and fanin/fanout are 0. Package coupling metrics (Ce=0, Ca=0) show no heavy dependency concentration. There is no evidence of excessive lines of code or a large number of classes that would justify labeling this package as a God Component."
