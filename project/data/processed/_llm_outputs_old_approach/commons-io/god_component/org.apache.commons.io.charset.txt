    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.io.charset",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and 48 LOC in total (classes: CharsetEncoders 29 LOC, CharsetDecoders 19 LOC). Method counts are small (nom 3 and 2) and WMCs are low (3 and 2). Fan-in/fan-out are 0 and there are no package-level dependencies indicating centralization. Given the very small size and low complexity, this package is not excessively large and does not qualify as a God Component."
