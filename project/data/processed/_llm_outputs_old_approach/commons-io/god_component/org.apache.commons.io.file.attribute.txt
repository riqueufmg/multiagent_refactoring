    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.apache.commons.io.file.attribute",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only one class (num_classes = 1) and total LOC = 225, which is not excessively large in the provided context. The single class FileTimes has 225 LOC, 24 methods and WMC = 26 (moderate complexity) but no fan-in/fan-out or external dependencies. LCOM ≈ 0.71 indicates reasonable cohesion. There is no evidence of an excessively large number of classes or an unusually large component size that would justify labeling this package as a God Component."
