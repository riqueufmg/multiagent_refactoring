Cohesion appears high (LCOM=-1.0), there is no incoming or outgoing coupling recorded (fanin=0, fanout=0), and it exposes a minimal interface. Although its inheritance depth is 4 (DIT=4), the class does not show signs of a bloated interface or concentrated, separable responsibilities based on the available metrics."
