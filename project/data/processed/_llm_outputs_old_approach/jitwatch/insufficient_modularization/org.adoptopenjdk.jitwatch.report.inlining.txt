      "justification": "The class exhibits signs of a bloated abstraction: moderate size (52 LOC) combined with relatively high complexity (WMC=14) for only 5 methods, and a non-negligible lack of cohesion (LCOM=0.6). Its dependency list spans many unrelated concepts (reporting, bytecode annotations, model parsing, tags, exception types and dictionaries), indicating it handles multiple responsibilities (report generation + bytecode annotation building/parsing). DIT=3 suggests increased behavioral surface through inheritance, making the class harder to decompose and maintain. Together these factors indicate the abstraction is insufficiently modularized and would benefit from splitting responsibilities into smaller, more cohesive classes."
