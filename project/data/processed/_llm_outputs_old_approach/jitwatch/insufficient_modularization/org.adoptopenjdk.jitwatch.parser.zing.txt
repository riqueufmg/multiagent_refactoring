High WMC and size indicate multiple responsibilities and complex control flow within a single class, making it a candidate for decomposition (e.g., splitting parsing stages or handlers)."

Although measured cohesion is low (lcom=0.0), the sheer number of methods and public members suggests a bloated abstraction that likely bundles many responsibilities and could be split into smaller, more focused classes (data holder vs. parsing/processing helpers)."
