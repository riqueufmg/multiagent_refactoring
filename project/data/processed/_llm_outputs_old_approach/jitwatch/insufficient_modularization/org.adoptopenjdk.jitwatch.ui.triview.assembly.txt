It depends on many types across assembly, architecture, bytecode and UI packages (multiple responsibilities such as parsing, rendering, UI integration). This concentration of size, complexity and cross-cutting dependencies indicates the class likely combines responsibilities that should be split into smaller, more cohesive modules."
