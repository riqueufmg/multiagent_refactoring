It implements 10 methods while depending on multiple subsystems (report, model, parsing/util, compilation), and it is the sole class in its package (package LOC equals the class LOC). These facts indicate concentrated responsibilities, significant internal complexity, and insufficient decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
