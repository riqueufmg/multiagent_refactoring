      "justification": "The class is small (41 LOC) with only 4 methods and moderate complexity (WMC=8). Although LCOM=0.75 suggests some cohesion concerns and all methods are public (nopm=4), the overall size and low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0, minimal external dependencies) do not indicate a bloated, hard-to-manage abstraction. On balance, the data do not support that this class suffers from insufficient modularization."
