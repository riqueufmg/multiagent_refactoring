It depends on a wide range of bytecode, model and process classes, indicating it handles parsing, mapping, javap/reflection interactions and model construction. The combination of size, method count, high cyclomatic complexity and broad dependency surface strongly suggests multiple responsibilities that should be decomposed."

      "detection": false,
      "justification": "Very small utility-like class (loc 10, nom 2, wmc 2) with minimal members and complexity, suggesting a single focused responsibility rather than insufficient modularization."

Cohesion metric (lcom ~0.29) does not indicate severe lack of cohesion and its dependency set is limited, so it does not clearly suffer from insufficient modularization based on the provided data."
