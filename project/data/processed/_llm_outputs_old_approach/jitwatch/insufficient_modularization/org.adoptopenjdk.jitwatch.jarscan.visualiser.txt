      "detection": true,
      "justification": "The package contains only one class (num_classes = 1), indicating lack of decomposition at the package level. HistoPlotter itself is relatively large and complex for a single class (loc = 154, nom = 12, nof = 8) with a high cyclomatic/complexity signal (wmc = 24). It has no inheritance depth (dit = 0) and low external reuse (fanin = 0), suggesting it centralizes behavior rather than delegating. The moderate cohesion measure (lcom = 0.333) combined with many fields and methods implies multiple responsibilities are concentrated in this class (visualisation and UI/plot logic), consistent with insufficient modularization."
