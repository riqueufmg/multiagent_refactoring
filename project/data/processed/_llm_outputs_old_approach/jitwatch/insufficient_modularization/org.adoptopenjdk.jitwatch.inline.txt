Cohesion is only moderate (lcom=0.5). It also contains two sizeable inner classes (InlineJournalVisitor loc=75 and InlineFailureInfo loc=32) in the same compilation unit, indicating multiple responsibilities bundled together rather than cleanly separated — signs that the abstraction would benefit from decomposition/extraction of responsibilities into smaller, focused classes."
