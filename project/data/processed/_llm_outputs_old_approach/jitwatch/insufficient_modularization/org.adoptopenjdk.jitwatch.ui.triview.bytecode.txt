The class depends on many different concerns (model, bytecode annotation/building, parsing/utilities, reporting, UI navigation), suggesting it mixes multiple responsibilities (UI rendering, parsing, annotation, navigation, reporting) instead of delegating them to smaller cohesive classes—signs of a bloated abstraction that should be decomposed."
