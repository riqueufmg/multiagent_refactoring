      "detection": true,
      "justification": "The class centralizes responsibilities for many language-specific compilers and runtimes (dependencies include Compiler/Runtime classes for Java, Scala, Kotlin, JavaScript, Groovy, JRuby), indicating concentration of cross-cutting concerns. It is the only class in its package (package has 1 class), suggesting the abstraction was not decomposed into smaller modules. Internal metrics show relatively high complexity (WMC=43) and moderate cohesion (LCOM=0.5) across 8 methods and 123 LOC, consistent with a bloated class handling multiple responsibilities. These factors together indicate insufficient modularization."
