The class holds many fields and methods and also defines nested types, depends on both UI and model packages, indicating it concentrates multiple responsibilities (UI presentation, data handling, plotting/queue counting). Despite a low LCOM value, the absolute size and high complexity suggest it has not been adequately decomposed and would benefit from separating concerns into smaller, focused classes."
