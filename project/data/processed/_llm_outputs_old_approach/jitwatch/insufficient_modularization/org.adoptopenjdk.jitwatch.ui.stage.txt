It depends on diverse concerns (IMetaMember, ICompilationChangeListener, UserInterfaceUtil, IStageClosedListener), indicating it coordinates multiple responsibilities. The large public interface combined with size and complexity suggests it concentrates responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more focused classes."
