    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.chain",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 228 LOC, which is not excessively large in terms of number of classes or overall code size. Individual class metrics (CompileNode: 111 LOC, WMC 28; CompileChainWalker: 117 LOC, WMC 18) show moderate complexity but not a dominating, monolithic component. Afferent/efferent counts (Ca=2, Ce=3) and the limited package dependencies also do not indicate an overly large or central component. Based on these provided metrics, there is no strong evidence this package is a God Component."
