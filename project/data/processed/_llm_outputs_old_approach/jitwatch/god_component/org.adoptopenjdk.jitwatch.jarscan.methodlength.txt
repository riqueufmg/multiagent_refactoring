    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.methodlength",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class (num_classes = 1) with 57 LOC at package level and the class MethodLengthOperation also has 57 LOC. These sizes are small and not 'excessive'. Class complexity indicators (wmc = 9, nom = 4, nopm = 4) and low coupling (fanout = 0, fanin = 0) do not suggest a large, sprawling component. Therefore, based on the provided metrics, this package does not qualify as a God Component."
