    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.stage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and 140 LOC (IStageClosedListener: 3 LOC; StageManager: 137 LOC). While StageManager is the dominant class (15 methods, WMC=31) its size and complexity are moderate in the given context and the package does not exhibit excessive LOC or an unusually large number of classes. Coupling metrics (Ce=3, Ca=2) are also not extreme. Therefore the package does not meet the contextual criteria for a God Component."
