    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and 199 LOC overall, which is not excessively large for a component. Although one class (Dialogs) dominates the package (183 LOC, ~92% of package LOC, 15 methods, WMC 21), the package as a whole is small in both LOC and class count. Coupling values (Ce=1, Ca=3) are moderate. These facts indicate the package is not a God Component, though the Dialogs class itself shows signs of being a large/central class (possible God Class) rather than the package being an excessively large component."
