    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 99 LOC, so it is not excessively large in number of classes or overall size. Although AbstractProcess dominates the package (95 LOC, 9 methods, WMC 19, NC 13), this single-class concentration does not by itself constitute a 'God Component' given the small package scope and modest total LOC. No evidence of an excessively large component in terms of classes or overwhelmingly large LOC is present."
