    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.launch",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package has only 2 classes and 159 LOC, but one class (LaunchHeadless) accounts for 152 LOC (~95% of package LOC). LaunchHeadless also shows high complexity (WMC=30), many methods (NOM=10), and numerous external dependencies (listed parser, model, util, report, inline, treevisitor, etc.). The package coupling metrics (Ce=8, Ca=0) indicate heavy outgoing dependencies with no incoming, suggesting centralized responsibilities. The dominance of a single large, complex class that depends on many subsystems supports detection of a God Component."
