    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.eliminatedallocation",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 101 LOC (EliminatedAllocationRowBuilder: 69 LOC; EliminatedAllocationRowBean: 32 LOC). Neither the number of classes nor the LOC indicate an excessively large component. Class-level metrics (WMC 8 for both, low fanin/fanout) do not show extreme complexity or centralization. Dependencies are limited. Based on the provided data, the package is small and does not meet the contextual criteria for a God Component."
