    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.filechooser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 146 LOC, with the largest class at 123 LOC. Class-level metrics show modest complexity (WMC 21 for the largest class) and minimal fan-in/fan-out. Given the small number of classes and overall lines of code, there is no evidence that this package is excessively large enough to qualify as a God Component."
