    "justification": "The package contains a single class and is very small (num_classes=1, package LOC=28). The sole class ViewerSource has LOC=28, WMC=5, NOM=2, low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0) and small public surface. There is no indication of excessive size or a large number of classes that would justify a God Component designation."
