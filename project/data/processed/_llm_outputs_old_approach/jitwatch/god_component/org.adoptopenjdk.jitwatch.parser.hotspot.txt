    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.hotspot",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class (HotSpotLogParser) that accounts for the whole package (loc 253). That class shows high internal complexity and size: WMC 70, 19 methods (nom), and LOC 253, indicating many responsibilities concentrated in one component. The class depends on multiple other packages/classes (assembly, model, core, util) and has non-trivial couplings (Ce=4, Ca=1), suggesting it plays a central role. These factors (single-class package, large LOC and method count, very high complexity and many external dependencies) support identifying a God Component where functionality is excessively concentrated in one component."
