    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package has 3 classes and 487 LOC, but one class (CompilerThreadStage) alone accounts for 467 LOC (~96% of package LOC). CompilerThreadStage also has high structural complexity (wmc=77), many methods (nom=28) and fields (nof=17), while the other classes are trivial (1–19 LOC). This strong size and complexity concentration in a single class indicates an excessively large component (God Component) despite the small number of classes."
