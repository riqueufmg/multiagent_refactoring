    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 1,706 LOC across 12 classes with extreme concentration in a single class: JITWatchUI (983 LOC, 79 methods, WMC 174) which alone accounts for ~58% of the package LOC. Additional large classes (ClassMemberList: 222 LOC, 27 methods, WMC 45; ClassTree: 192 LOC, 16 methods, WMC 48) further indicate a small number of classes holding most functionality. JITWatchUI also depends on a very large number of other components (many external stages, viewers, parsers, walkers, utilities), showing high coupling and coordination responsibilities. The combination of very large LOC, high method count and cyclomatic complexity concentrated in a single class (and a few other large classes) supports that this package exhibits the God Component smell."
