    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.histo",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes and a total of 239 LOC, which is small in absolute terms and not indicative of an excessively large component. The largest classes are InlineSizeHistoVisitable (94 LOC, WMC 17) and Histo (77 LOC, WMC 15) — moderate sizes/complexities but not dominating at an extreme level. Class cohesion metrics (LCOM values low/near 0), shallow inheritance depths (DIT 0–3), zero/low fanin/fanout, and low external coupling (Ce=3, Ca=2) further indicate the package is reasonably modular. Therefore there is insufficient evidence to classify this package as a God Component."
