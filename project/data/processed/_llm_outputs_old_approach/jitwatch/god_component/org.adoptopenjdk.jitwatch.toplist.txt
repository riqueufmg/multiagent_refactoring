    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 12 classes with a total of 277 LOC — a modest overall size. The largest class (InliningFailReasonTopListVisitable) is 77 LOC with WMC 14, but most classes are small (many under ~30 LOC) and have low complexity and few methods. Coupling indicators are low: Ca (incoming) = 1 and fanin/fanout values at class level are 0 for most classes, showing no single highly central class with many dependents. The functionality appears distributed across several small, focused classes rather than concentrated in one excessively large component, so the evidence does not support a God Component detection."
