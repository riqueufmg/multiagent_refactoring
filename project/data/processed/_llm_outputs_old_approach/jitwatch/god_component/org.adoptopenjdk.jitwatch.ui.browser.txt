    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.browser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class (num_classes = 1) and very small code size (loc = 19). The sole class BrowserStage has low complexity metrics (wmc = 3, loc = 19, nof = 2) and no incoming fan-in, indicating limited responsibility. There is no evidence of an excessively large number of classes or large LOC that would justify labeling it a God Component."
