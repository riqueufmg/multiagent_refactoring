    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 4 classes and 246 LOC overall, which is not excessively large for a package. However, one class (CompilationUtil) dominates the package with 224 LOC (~91% of package LOC), high complexity (WMC=54), 12 methods and 10 public methods, indicating a concentrated large/complex class inside the package. The package-level metrics (num_classes=4, loc=246) do not support calling the whole component a God Component, though they reveal a likely God Class within the package."
