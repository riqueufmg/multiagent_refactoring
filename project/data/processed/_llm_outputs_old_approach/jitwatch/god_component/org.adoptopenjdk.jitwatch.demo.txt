    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class (num_classes=1) that accounts for all package LOC (331). The class MakeHotSpotLog has 331 LOC, 39 methods (nom=39) and a high complexity score (wmc=66), indicating many responsibilities concentrated in one component. Additionally the package has no other classes or external coupling (Ce=0, Ca=0), so functionality is centralized in this one large class — characteristics that support the God Component smell."
