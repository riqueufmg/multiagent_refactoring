    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.visualiser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class (num_classes=1) with 154 LOC, which is moderate in size and not excessively large for a component. Class-level metrics show 12 methods and WMC=24 (some complexity) but LCOM=0.333 and fanin/fanout=0, suggesting cohesion and low coupling. Package coupling is low (Ca=0, Ce=1). There is no evidence of an excessively large number of classes or extreme LOC that would justify labeling this package a God Component."
