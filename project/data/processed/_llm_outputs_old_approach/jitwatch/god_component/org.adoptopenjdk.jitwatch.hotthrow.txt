{
    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.hotthrow",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 169 LOC, which is not an excessive size for a component. Class-level sizes are moderate (HotThrowFinder: 118 LOC, WMC 20; HotThrowResult: 51 LOC, WMC 18) but do not by themselves indicate a single overwhelmingly large component. There are a small number of external couplings (Ce=4, Ca=1) and no large number of contained classes, so there is insufficient evidence to label this package a God Component."
