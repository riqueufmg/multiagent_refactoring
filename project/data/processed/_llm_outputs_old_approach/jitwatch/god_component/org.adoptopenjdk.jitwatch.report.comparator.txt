    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.comparator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and 10 LOC in total (each class ~5 LOC). Class metrics show very low complexity (wmc=1), low coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0), and minimal dependencies. There is no evidence of excessive size in terms of lines of code or number of classes, so the God Component smell is not present."
