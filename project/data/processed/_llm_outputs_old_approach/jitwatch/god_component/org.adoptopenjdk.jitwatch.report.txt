    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": ["org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report"],
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and 99 LOC in total, so it is not excessively large in terms of classes or size. The largest class (Report) is 80 LOC with 12 methods and WMC 28, while the other classes are very small (AbstractReportBuilder 18 LOC, ReportType 1 LOC). Although Report has moderate complexity, the overall package size and class count do not indicate a God Component."
