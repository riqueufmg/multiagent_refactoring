    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.graphing",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 4 classes and 590 LOC, with functionality clearly split into distinct classes (TimeLineStage 200 LOC, AbstractGraphStage 199 LOC, CodeCacheStage 106 LOC, HistoStage 85 LOC). Afferent coupling is low (Ca=1) and classes show reasonable cohesion (low LCOM values). Although two classes have relatively high complexity (WMC 36 and 30), the size and class count are moderate and responsibilities appear separated, so the package as a whole is not excessively large to qualify as a God Component."
