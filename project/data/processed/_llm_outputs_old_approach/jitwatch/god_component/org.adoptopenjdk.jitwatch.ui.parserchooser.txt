    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and 26 LOC, which is small. Individual classes are tiny (IParserSelectedListener: LOC 3, WMC 1, 1 method; ParserChooser: LOC 23, WMC 4, 4 methods). Coupling metrics show no high fan-in/fan-out (both 0) and dependencies are minimal. There is no evidence of an excessively large component in terms of lines of code or number of classes."
