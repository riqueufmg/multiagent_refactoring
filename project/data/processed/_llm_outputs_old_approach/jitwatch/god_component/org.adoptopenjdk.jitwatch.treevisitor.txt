    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and 27 total LOC, which is small and not 'excessively large'. Class-level metrics show TreeVisitor with 23 LOC, 3 methods and WMC 7 and ITreeVisitable with 4 LOC and 2 methods. Fanout/fanin are zero and dependencies are limited. There is no concentration of size, complexity, or many classes that would indicate a God Component in this package."
