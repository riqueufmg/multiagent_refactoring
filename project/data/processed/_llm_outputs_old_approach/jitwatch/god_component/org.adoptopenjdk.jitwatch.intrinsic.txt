    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.intrinsic",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only one class (IntrinsicFinder) with 89 LOC. Although IntrinsicFinder has a WMC of 14, the overall package size (num_classes=1, loc=89) is modest and there is no large aggregation of classes or extremely high LOC for the component. Dependencies are limited. Based on the provided metrics, there is insufficient evidence of an excessively large component to classify this as a God Component."
