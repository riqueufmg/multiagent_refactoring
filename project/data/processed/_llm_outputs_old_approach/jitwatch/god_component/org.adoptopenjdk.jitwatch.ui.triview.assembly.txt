    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.assembly",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and 259 LOC overall, so it is not excessively large by package-class-count. Although ViewerAssembly is the dominant class (loc 249, nom 15, wmc 57) indicating a relatively large and complex class, the package as a whole is small (num_classes=2) and cohesion metrics (LCOM ~0.13) are not indicative of widespread bloat. Efferent coupling (Ce=7) and afferent coupling (Ca=1) are moderate. Therefore, using the provided contextual data, the package does not qualify as a God Component even if one class within it is relatively large."
