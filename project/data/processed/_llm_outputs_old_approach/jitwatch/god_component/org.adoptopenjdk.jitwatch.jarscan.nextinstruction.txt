    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.nextinstruction",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and 84 LOC overall, which is small and not indicative of an excessively large component. The largest class (NextInstructionOperation) is 55 LOC with moderate complexity (WMC 12), while the other two classes are 14 and 15 LOC with low complexity. Afferent/efferent coupling is minimal (Ca=1, Ce=2) and there is no evidence of many responsibilities concentrated in a single class or an unusually high number of classes within the package. Therefore, the data do not support detection of a God Component."
