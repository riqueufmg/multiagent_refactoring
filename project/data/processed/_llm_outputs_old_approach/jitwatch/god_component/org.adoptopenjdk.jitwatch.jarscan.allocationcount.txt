    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 3 classes and a total of 93 LOC, with individual class LOCs of 36, 37 and 20 (no single class dominates). Per-class complexity metrics are low-to-moderate (WMCs 9, 6, 4), low method counts, and low coupling (Ce=1, Ca=1, fanin/fanout mostly 0). Given the small number of classes, modest LOC, and absence of high complexity or high coupling, there is no evidence of an excessively large (God) component."
