    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.javap",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 140 LOC (classes: ReflectionJavap 94 LOC, JavapProcess 46 LOC). Class-level metrics show modest method counts (nom 5 and 4), moderate complexity (WMC 12 and 9) and low coupling (fanin/fanout 0, Ca=1, Ce=1). Given the small number of classes, moderate LOC per class and low coupling, there is no evidence that this component is excessively large in terms of size or class count, so it does not qualify as a God Component."
