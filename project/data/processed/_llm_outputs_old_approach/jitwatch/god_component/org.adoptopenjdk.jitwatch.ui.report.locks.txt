    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.locks",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 105 LOC (classes: 69 LOC and 36 LOC). Method counts are modest (nom ~8 and ~7) and WMC values are moderate (8 and 10). Fan-in/fan-out are zero for the listed classes and package-level coupling is low (Ce=2, Ca=1). Given the small number of classes, low overall LOC and limited coupling, there is no evidence this package is an excessively large or dominant component (i.e., a God Component)."
