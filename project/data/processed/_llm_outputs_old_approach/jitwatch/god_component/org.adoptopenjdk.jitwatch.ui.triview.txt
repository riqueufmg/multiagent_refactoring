    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 10 classes but is heavily dominated by two very large, highly complex classes: TriView (751 LOC, 55 methods, WMC 173) and Viewer (386 LOC, 42 methods, WMC 92). The package total LOC is 1468, so TriView and Viewer together account for ~77% of the package LOC, indicating a concentration of responsibility. Both classes have large method counts and high complexity metrics, and TriView has many external dependencies across model, bytecode, UI and loader subsystems, showing high coupling and multiple responsibilities. These factors (large absolute LOC, skewed LOC distribution toward a few classes, many methods and high WMC, and wide dependency surface) support detecting a God Component smell for this package."
