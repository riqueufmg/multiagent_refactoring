    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only one class (LanguageManager) and totals 123 LOC (num_classes=1, loc=123). While the class shows relatively high complexity (wmc=43) and several dependencies, the package is not excessively large in terms of lines of code or number of classes, so it does not qualify as a God Component based on the provided data."
