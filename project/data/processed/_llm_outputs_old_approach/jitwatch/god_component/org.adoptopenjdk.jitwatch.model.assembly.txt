    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 11 classes and a total of 1,047 LOC, which is high concentration of code and responsibility for a single component. Several classes are individually large and complex: AssemblyReference (216 LOC, WMC 32), AssemblyInstruction (178 LOC, WMC 41, 15 methods), AssemblyProcessor (186 LOC, WMC 46) and AbstractAssemblyParser (138 LOC, WMC 32). These classes hold substantial logic (many methods and high cyclomatic complexity) indicating the package centralizes parsing/processing responsibilities. Given the volume of LOC concentrated in a small set of classes and the high internal complexity, the package shows the characteristics of a God Component."
