    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.invokecount",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and 83 total LOC, with individual class LOCs of 20, 36, and 27. Method and complexity metrics (WMC 4, 6, and 10) are modest and there is no indication of large inheritance depth or high coupling (fanin/fanout are 0, Ca=1, Ce=2). Given the small number of classes, low total LOC and moderate per-class complexity, it does not meet the contextual criteria for a God Component (not excessively large in LOC or number of classes)."
