    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.inlining",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class and 52 LOC, which is not 'excessively' large in terms of lines of code or number of classes. The single class (InliningWalker) has LOC 52 and WMC 14 (moderate complexity), with fanin/fanout = 0 and no indication of very high coupling. Package coupling metrics are low (Ce = 3, Ca = 1). There is no evidence in the provided data of an oversized component that would justify labeling it a God Component."
