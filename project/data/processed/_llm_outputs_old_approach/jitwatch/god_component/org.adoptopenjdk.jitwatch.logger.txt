    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package is very small: 3 classes and total LOC = 18 (class LOCs: ILogListener=4, StdLogListener=8, NullLogListener=6). Class complexities are low (wmc ≈ 2 for each), few methods per class, and there is no sign of an excessive number of classes or large source size that would indicate a God Component. Based on these metrics and the small scale of the package, it does not qualify as a God Component."
