    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.freqinlinesize",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class and a total of 57 LOC, so it is not excessively large in terms of number of classes or lines of code. The single class (FreqInlineSizeOperation) has 57 LOC, WMC 9 and NOM 4, indicating moderate internal complexity but not a massive or monolithic component. Dependency counts (Ce=3, Ca=1) are small to moderate and do not suggest the package centralizes an excessive portion of the system. Based on these elements, the package does not meet the contextual criteria for a God Component."
