    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class (SuggestionWalker) that concentrates functionality: 310 LOC, 32 fields (nof = 32), 10 methods (nom = 10) with a high weighted method count (wmc = 45). The package has only 1 class (num_classes = 1), indicating responsibilities are centralized rather than distributed. SuggestionWalker also depends on multiple other packages/classes (several external dependencies) and the package shows non‑trivial coupling (Ce = 4, Ca = 2). These elements together (large class size, many fields, high complexity and cross-package dependencies) support detecting a God Component—functionality and complexity are excessively concentrated in one component."
