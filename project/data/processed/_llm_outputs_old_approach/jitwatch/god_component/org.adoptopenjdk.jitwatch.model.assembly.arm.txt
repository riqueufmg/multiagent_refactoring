    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly.arm",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes and 328 LOC in total — not an excessive size for a component. Although AssemblyParserARM is relatively large (214 LOC, WMC 56) and accounts for ~65% of the package LOC, the remaining five classes are small (8–33 LOC) and the package has low external coupling (Ce=1, Ca=2). The overall package size and class count do not indicate an excessively large component, so a God Component is not detected; the issue, if any, is a single large/parser class rather than the entire component."
