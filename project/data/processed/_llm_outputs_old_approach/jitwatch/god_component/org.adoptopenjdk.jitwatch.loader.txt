    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains only 4 classes and 659 LOC but one class, BytecodeLoader, accounts for 541 LOC (~82% of package LOC). BytecodeLoader also has high complexity and size indicators (WMC 119, NOM 25) and a long dependency list, while the remaining classes are small (ResourceLoader 107 LOC, others ~10 LOC or 1 LOC). The concentration of most functionality and size in a single class (many methods, high complexity and many dependencies) indicates an excessively large component within this package, consistent with the God Component smell."
