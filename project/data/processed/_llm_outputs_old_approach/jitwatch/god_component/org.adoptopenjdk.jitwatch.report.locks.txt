    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.locks",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class (OptimisedLocksWalker) with only 8 LOC and low complexity (wmc=2, nom=2, nof=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). The package has num_classes=1 and overall loc=8, indicating it is very small both in lines of code and number of classes. There is no evidence of an excessively large or monolithic component, so the God Component smell is not present."
