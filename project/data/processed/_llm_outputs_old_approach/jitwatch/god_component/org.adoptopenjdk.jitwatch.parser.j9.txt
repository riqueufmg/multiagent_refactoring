    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.parser.j9",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and a total of 249 LOC, which is not excessively large for a component. Although one class (J9Line) is the largest (143 LOC, 19 methods, WMC 22) and shows concentrated complexity, the package as a whole does not exhibit an excessive number of classes or unusually high total LOC. Coupling metrics (Ce=3, Ca=1) are moderate. Based on the provided data and contextual judgment, this package does not qualify as a God Component."
