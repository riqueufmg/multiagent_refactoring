    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 4 classes and a total of 190 LOC, which is small for a 'God Component'. The largest class (HtmlToPlainText) is 96 LOC — notable but not excessively large. Complexity metrics are modest (maximum WMC = 8), and class-level coupling (fanin/fanout = 0) is low. Package-level coupling (Ca = 4, Ce = 4) is moderate and does not indicate a single overwhelmingly central component. Based on class count, overall LOC, and modest complexity/coupling, there is insufficient evidence to classify this package as a God Component."
