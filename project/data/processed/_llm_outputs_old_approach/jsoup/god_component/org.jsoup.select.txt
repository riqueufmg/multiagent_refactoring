    "justification": "The package is excessively large and concentrates many responsibilities: 70 classes and 3,822 LOC in one package. Several very large/complex classes indicate centralization of functionality — Evaluator (773 LOC, 24 inner evaluator types), Elements (557 LOC, WMC 98), QueryParser (341 LOC, WMC 111), Nodes (247 LOC), StructuralEvaluator (220 LOC) and NodeTraversor (124 LOC). Numerous inner classes for different evaluation behaviours and high method/complexity metrics on core classes show the package handles parsing, querying, traversal and selection logic rather than a single cohesive responsibility, consistent with a God Component smell."
