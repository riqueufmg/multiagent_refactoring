    "justification": "Contextual judgment on the provided metrics indicates an excessively large component. The package contains 29 classes and 3,574 LOC overall, with several very large classes concentrated in the same package: HttpConnection (1,021 LOC, 48 methods, high complexity), HttpConnection.Response (388 LOC), W3CDom (343 LOC), DataUtil (316 LOC), Validate (191 LOC). Multiple classes also show high method counts and complexity (e.g. HttpConnection.nom=48, DataUtil.nom=19, W3CDom.nom=18), and the package mixes diverse responsibilities (HTTP connection handling, response processing, data utilities, DOM conversion, validation). These elements together support detecting a God Component in org.jsoup.helper."
