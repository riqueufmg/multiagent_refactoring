    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package totals 1,585 LOC across 11 classes, but size and responsibility are highly concentrated: org.jsoup.Connection is 772 LOC with 43 methods and WMC 43, and org.jsoup.JSoup is 269 LOC with 24 methods and WMC 25 — these two classes account for the majority (~64%) of the package LOC and large numbers of methods/complexity. The package also shows substantial coupling (Ce=8, Ca=8) and many dependencies to other internal packages, indicating centralized, highly connected functionality. This concentration of code, methods, and complexity in a few large classes supports detection of a God Component at the package level."
