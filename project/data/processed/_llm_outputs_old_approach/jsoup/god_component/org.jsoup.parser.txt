    "justification": "Contextual judgement based on the provided data indicates the package concentrates a very large amount of functionality and code in a single component. The package contains 30 classes but a large total of 7,615 LOC, with several classes disproportionately large and highly complex: HtmlTreeBuilderState (1,735 LOC, WMC 473, nom 45), TokeniserState (1,386 LOC, WMC 409, nom 75), HtmlTreeBuilder (765 LOC, WMC 227, nom 95), CharacterReader (533 LOC, WMC 130, nom 57), Token (397 LOC, nom 20), TokenQueue (396 LOC, WMC 86, nom 34), Parser (298 LOC, nom 30). Multiple classes have very high cyclomatic complexity (WMC values up to 473/409) and large numbers of methods, showing concentrated responsibility and complexity inside this package. These facts (high total LOC, many very large/complex classes, and concentrated functionality) support the detection of a God Component in org.jsoup.parser."
