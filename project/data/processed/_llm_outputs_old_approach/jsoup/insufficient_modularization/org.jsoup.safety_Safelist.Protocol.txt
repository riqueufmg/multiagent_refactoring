      "justification": "The class is very small (loc=8) with no methods (nom=0), zero complexity indicators (wmc=0), and no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate a minimal, focused abstraction (likely an enum or simple value holder) rather than a large, responsibility-concentrating class, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
