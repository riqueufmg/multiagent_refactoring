      "justification": "The class is small (loc 54) and shows no signs of high internal complexity or a bloated interface: WMC is 0 (no measured complexity), fan-in and fan-out are 0 (low coupling), and method/field counts are not large. Although some metrics (e.g., LCOM) are not usefully computed here, the available data indicate the class does not concentrate excessive responsibilities or size that would suggest insufficient modularization."
