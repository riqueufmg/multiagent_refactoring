      "justification": "The class is small (LOC 27) with a single field and no methods (nom = 0, wmc = 0), indicating minimal internal complexity and responsibilities. Low coupling is shown by fanin = 0 and fanout = 0, and inheritance depth is minimal (dit = 1). These metrics suggest the class is a focused, lightweight helper rather than a bloated abstraction that should be decomposed, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
