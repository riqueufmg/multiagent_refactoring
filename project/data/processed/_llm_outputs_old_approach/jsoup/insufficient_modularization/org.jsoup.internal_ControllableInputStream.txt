      "justification": "The class concentrates considerable size and behavior: 17 methods (14 public), 169 LOC and a high WMC of 34, which indicate substantial internal complexity and a bloated interface. Its dependencies (org.jsoup.Progress, org.jsoup.internal.SimpleBufferedInput, org.jsoup.helper.Validate) imply it handles multiple concerns (stream control, buffering, progress/validation). Although LCOM is low (0.18), suggesting internal cohesion, the large number of public methods and high complexity concentrated in a single class point to insufficient modularization — responsibilities should be separated into smaller, more focused abstractions (e.g., buffering, progress reporting, control logic)."
