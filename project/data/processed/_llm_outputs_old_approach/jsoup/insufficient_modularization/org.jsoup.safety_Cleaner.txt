      "justification": "Cleaner is moderate in size (133 LOC) with a small number of methods (nom=6) and fields (nof=6). It has a single moderate complexity score (WMC=10) and very high cohesion (LCOM=0.0). The class uses nested helper types (CleaningVisitor, ElementMeta) and depends on expected collaborators (Safelist, Document, Parser) which align with its single responsibility of cleaning HTML. There is no evidence of an overly large interface or many unrelated responsibilities, so the data do not indicate insufficient modularization."
