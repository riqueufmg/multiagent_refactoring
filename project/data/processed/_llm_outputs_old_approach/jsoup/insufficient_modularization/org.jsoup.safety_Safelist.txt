      "justification": "The class is large and complex (loc=399, wmc=54) with many methods (nom=22, nopm=20), indicating a bloated interface and concentrated responsibilities. It defines multiple inner abstractions (AttributeKey, TagName, AttributeValue, Protocol) and depends on varied concerns (normalization, element/attribute handling, protocols), suggesting responsibilities that could be separated. The combination of size, high complexity, many public methods and multiple conceptual responsibilities supports that Safelist is insufficiently modularized."
