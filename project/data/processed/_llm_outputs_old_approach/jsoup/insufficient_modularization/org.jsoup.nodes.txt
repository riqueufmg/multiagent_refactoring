Numerous dependencies and inner types (NodeList, TextAccumulator) indicate it mixes many responsibilities (DOM manipulation, parsing/formatting helpers, selection/traversal, cleaning/safety hooks). LCOM (~0.34) shows only moderate cohesion for the large API, suggesting the abstraction could be decomposed into focused components (e.g., mutation/DOM ops, parsing/tree-building, rendering/printing, selector utilities)."

Serves as a common ancestor but embeds many behaviors (traversal, printing, selection support, attribute handling references) and depends on many subsystems. As a base abstraction, it appears to aggregate diverse concerns that could be split into smaller collaborating abstractions (core node model vs traversal/printing/selectors)."

The class surface and mixed concerns (data storage vs parsing/normalization vs dataset API) indicate opportunities to separate storage, normalization, and dataset view logic."

It models the document and contains related settings (OutputSettings nested), with cohesion around document-level concerns (tree root, parsing entry points, output). While non-trivial, its responsibilities are cohesive for a Document abstraction and some decomposition (e.g., OutputSettings already separated) is present."

      "justification": "Relatively compact element representation: 272 LOC, 30 methods, WMC 53. Its role is a single attribute abstraction (name/value, normalization) and metrics and dependencies suggest focused responsibility rather than a bloated interface, so insufficient modularization is not evident."

The class groups related functionality (including nested types for modes/data) rather than mixing unrelated responsibilities, so it does not strongly exhibit insufficient modularization."
