      "justification": "The class is small (24 LOC) with a single field (nof=1), no methods recorded (nom=0), zero cyclomatic complexity (wmc=0), and no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate a focused, low-complexity wrapper role rather than a bloated or poorly decomposed abstraction, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
