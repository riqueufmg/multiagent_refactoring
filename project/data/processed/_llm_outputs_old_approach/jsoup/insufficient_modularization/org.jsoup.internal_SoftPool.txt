      "justification": "Class size and complexity are modest (loc 50, wmc 7), with a small number of methods (nom 4, public methods 3). Cohesion is high (lcom 0.0), indicating responsibilities are focused. The public interface is not bloated and there are no recorded incoming/outgoing couplings (fanin 0, fanout 0). These factors suggest the class is adequately decomposed and does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
