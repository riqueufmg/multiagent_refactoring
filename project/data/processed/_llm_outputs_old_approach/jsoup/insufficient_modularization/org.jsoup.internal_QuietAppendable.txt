      "justification": "The class is small and focused: 63 LOC, 4 methods and 2 fields, with modest complexity (WMC=5). It has no incoming or outgoing couplings (fanin=0, fanout=0), indicating it does not aggregate many responsibilities or coordinate many collaborators. The low number of methods and fields and contained scope (internal package utility) provide no evidence of a bloated interface or excessive responsibility concentration, so there is no sign of insufficient modularization."
