      "justification": "The class is very large and complex: LOC=522 and WMC=99 indicate high implementation size and cyclomatic complexity. It exposes a large surface: NOM=48 methods with NOPM=33 public methods, and NOF=14 fields — a bloated interface that is likely concentrating multiple responsibilities. Although LCOM is low (0.083), suggesting internal cohesion, the breadth of dependencies (Document, Normalizer, QuietAppendable, ParseSettings, SharedConstants, StringUtil, Range, Validate, etc.) implies the class handles concerns ranging from normalization, parsing/validation, to serialization/appendable logic rather than a single narrowly scoped role. DIT=0 (no inheritance decomposition) and the high method/complexity counts suggest the abstraction has not been sufficiently decomposed into smaller, more focused classes, which matches Insufficient Modularization."
