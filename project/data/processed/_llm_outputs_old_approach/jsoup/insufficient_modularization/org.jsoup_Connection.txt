      "justification": "The class is very large and complex: LOC 772, 43 methods (nom), and WMC 43. It appears to encompass multiple roles (nested/related types such as Request, Response, Method, KeyVal) and interacts with several subsystems (Document, Parser, RequestAuthenticator, Progress), indicating it mixes connection management, request/response modeling, authentication, and related concerns. The concentration of many methods and responsibilities in a single class with no inheritance depth (DIT 0) suggests it has not been adequately decomposed into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
