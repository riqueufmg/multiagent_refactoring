LCOM 0.0 indicates high cohesion and there are no incoming/outgoing coupling indications (fanin=0, fanout=0) beyond a single dependency. Although WMC=16 suggests some internal method complexity, the overall size, focused interface and high cohesion do not support a conclusion of insufficient modularization."
