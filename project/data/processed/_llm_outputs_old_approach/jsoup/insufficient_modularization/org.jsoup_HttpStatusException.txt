      "justification": "The class is small and focused: LOC 18, WMC 3, 3 methods and 2 fields. LCOM 0.0 indicates high cohesion. It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin/fanout 0) and no inheritance depth (DIT 0). These metrics suggest the class is not bloated and does not concentrate multiple responsibilities, so it does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
