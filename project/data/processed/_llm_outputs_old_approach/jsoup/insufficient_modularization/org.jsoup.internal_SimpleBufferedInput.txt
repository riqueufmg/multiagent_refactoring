The combination of many methods and high cyclomatic complexity indicates multiple responsibilities or dense internal logic that could be split. Only 2 declared external dependencies and zero fanout suggest behavior is concentrated inside the class rather than delegated, supporting that it is insufficiently decomposed despite a low LCOM value."
