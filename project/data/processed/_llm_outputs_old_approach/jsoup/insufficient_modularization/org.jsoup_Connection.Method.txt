      "justification": "Small size and low complexity: LOC=18, only 1 field and 0 methods (nof=1, nom=0), WMC=0. No incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0). Metrics indicate a tiny, likely cohesive abstraction (e.g., an enum or simple inner type) rather than a bloated class, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
