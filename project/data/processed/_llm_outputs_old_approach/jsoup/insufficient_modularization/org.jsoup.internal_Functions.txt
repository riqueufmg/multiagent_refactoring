      "justification": "Functions is small (loc 24) with a modest number of methods (nom 5) and fields (nof 4) and low complexity (wmc 5). It has no incoming or outgoing coupling (fanin 0, fanout 0), indicating a focused, low-coupling utility-style class rather than a bloated abstraction. Although LCOM is 1.0, at this small scale the limited size and low complexity do not support diagnosing insufficient modularization."
