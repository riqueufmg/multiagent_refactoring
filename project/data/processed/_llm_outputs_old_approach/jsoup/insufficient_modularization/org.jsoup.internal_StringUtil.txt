      "justification": "The class is large and behaviorally broad: 322 LOC, 26 methods, WMC 50 and 10 fields indicate substantial size and complexity. LCOM 0.5 (moderate cohesion) suggests responsibilities are not tightly focused. Presence of an inner helper (StringJoiner) and dependencies on Validate and SoftPool imply it handles multiple concerns (string joining/formatting, validation, pooling/support), consistent with a utility class that has not been decomposed. These factors together indicate insufficient modularization and a candidate for splitting into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."
