It depends on a variety of unrelated concerns (Document, Entities, Normalizer, Range, Attributes, StringUtil, Validate), suggesting multiple responsibilities (normalization, entity handling, formatting/serialization, validation/range logic) that could be separated. Although LCOM is low (0.13), the overall size, high complexity and wide dependency surface point to insufficient decomposition and modularization."
