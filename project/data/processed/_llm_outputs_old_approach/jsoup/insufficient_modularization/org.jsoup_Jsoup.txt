      "justification": "The class exposes a very large, mostly-public interface (24 methods total, 23 public), and is sizeable (269 LOC) with appreciable complexity (WMC 25). Its dependencies span multiple distinct concerns—parsing and document creation (org.jsoup.parser.Parser, org.jsoup.nodes.Document), input/data utilities (org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil), HTML cleaning/safety (org.jsoup.safety.Safelist, org.jsoup.safety.Cleaner) and connection/HTTP handling (org.jsoup.Connection, org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection)—indicating that it centralizes responsibilities that could be separated. The combination of many public methods, substantial implementation size, and coupling to diverse subsystems supports the judgment that Jsoup is insufficiently modularized and would benefit from decomposing responsibilities into smaller, cohesive abstractions."
