    "justification": "The package is excessively large: 76 classes and 8,184 LOC overall. Several individual classes are very large and centralize complexity (e.g., JavaInputAstVisitor: 3,233 LOC, 167 methods, WMC 560 — ~40% of package LOC; JavaInput: 474 LOC, WMC 64; StringWrapper: 328 LOC, WMC 46; ImportOrderer: 370 LOC, WMC 54; JavaOutput: 277 LOC, WMC 63). The package contains many big classes and nested types, high method counts and complexity concentrated in a few components, which matches the God Component smell (a component excessively large in LOC and number of classes)."
