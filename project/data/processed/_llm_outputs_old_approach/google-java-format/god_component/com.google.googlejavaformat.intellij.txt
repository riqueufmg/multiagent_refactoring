    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.googlejavaformat.intellij",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 10 classes totaling 381 LOC which is moderate rather than excessive. Responsibilities are distributed across multiple focused classes (e.g., GoogleJavaFormatFormattingService LOC 70, GoogleJavaFormatConfigurable LOC 73, GoogleJavaFormatSettings LOC 60, JreConfigurationChecker LOC 50, import optimizer LOC 43) and several very small utility/state classes (LOC 1–33). No single class dominates the package in LOC or complexity (largest class 73 LOC, WMC up to 14). Coupling is low (Ca = 0, Ce = 1) and classes have limited fan-in/fan-out, indicating responsibilities are separated. Based on this distribution and the provided metrics, there is no clear evidence that this package is an excessively large God Component."
