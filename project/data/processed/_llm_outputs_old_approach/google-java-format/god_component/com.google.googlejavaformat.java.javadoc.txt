    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.googlejavaformat.java.javadoc",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 10 classes and 888 LOC with a clear concentration of size and complexity in a few classes: JavadocLexer (375 LOC, WMC 81, many methods) and JavadocWriter (247 LOC, WMC 50) plus JavadocFormatter (99 LOC). These two classes alone account for the majority of the package LOC and exhibit high complexity and large method counts, indicating that the package centralizes substantial responsibilities related to Javadoc lexing/formatting. The combination of total LOC, number of classes and the presence of several very large/complex classes supports identifying this package as a God Component."
