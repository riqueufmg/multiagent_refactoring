Cohesion is high (lcom=0.0), indicating related responsibilities rather than a mix of unrelated ones. Complexity is moderate (wmc=13) but not excessive for a logic/helper class. There is no inheritance depth (dit=0) and the class does not show a bloated public API (nopm=2). Although it depends on several resolver types (expected for its role), the metrics do not indicate an overloaded or insufficiently decomposed abstraction."
