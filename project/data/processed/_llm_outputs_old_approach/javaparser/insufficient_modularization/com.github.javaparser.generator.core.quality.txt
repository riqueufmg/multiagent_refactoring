      "detection": false,
      "justification": "The class is relatively small (93 LOC) and exposes a limited interface (nopm = 2 public methods) while containing a modest number of internal methods (nom = 8). Its complexity (WMC = 18) is not extreme given its role as a code generator and its LCOM value is negative (-1.0), indicating good internal cohesion. Coupling appears low (fanin = 0, fanout = 0 at class-level metrics provided) and dependencies are focused on AST and parsing types consistent with a single responsibility (generating not-null-related code). Together these factors suggest the class is focused and cohesive rather than an unduly large, mixed-responsibility abstraction, so there is no strong evidence of insufficient modularization."
