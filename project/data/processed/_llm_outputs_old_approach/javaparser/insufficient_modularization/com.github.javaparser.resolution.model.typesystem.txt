The high nom appears implemented as cohesive, small behaviors rather than a bloated, multi-responsibility abstraction, so there is not sufficient evidence of insufficient modularization."

      "justification": "ReferenceTypeImpl shows signs of an insufficiently modularized abstraction: high complexity and size (LOC=161, WMC=45), many methods and many public methods (nom=17, nopm=14), and relatively poor cohesion (lcom=0.8235). Its wide set of dependencies (MethodUsage, FunctionalInterfaceLogic, type parameters, reference type declarations) indicates multiple responsibilities being handled in one class, suggesting it should be decomposed into smaller, more focused abstractions."

      "justification": "NullType is small and simple (LOC=27, nom=7, WMC=7) with few public methods (nopm=6). Although lcom=1.0 suggests low field-sharing cohesion, the class size and low complexity indicate a lightweight, likely single-purpose representation (e.g., a null/type placeholder) rather than a bloated abstraction, so insufficient modularization is not evident."
