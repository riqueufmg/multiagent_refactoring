Its LCOM is very high (0.983), indicating low cohesion across its many methods. As a wide-reaching superclass with extensive responsibilities, it appears insufficiently decomposed and likely should be split or its responsibilities refactored into smaller, more cohesive abstractions."

Its complexity is concentrated but cohesive, suggesting modularization at the class level is appropriate rather than insufficient."
