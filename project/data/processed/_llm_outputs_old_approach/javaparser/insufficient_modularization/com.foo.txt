      "justification": "Widget is small (20 LOC) with low complexity (WMC=3), a small number of methods (3) and fields (3), no inheritance (DIT=0) and no children, and minimal coupling visible at class level (fanin=0, fanout=0). Although LCOM=1.0 indicates low cohesion and there are several external type references, the overall size and low complexity suggest the class is not a bloated abstraction that requires further decomposition — the cohesion warning alone, given the small scope, is insufficient to conclude Insufficient Modularization."
