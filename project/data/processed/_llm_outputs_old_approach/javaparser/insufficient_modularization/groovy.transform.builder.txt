      "justification": "Class has a relatively high method count (15 methods) and a high cyclomatic/weighted complexity (WMC=26) within a modest size (117 LOC), combined with very low cohesion (LCOM≈0.93). It also declares few fields (2) and shows no incoming/outgoing package dependencies, suggesting many responsibilities are implemented as methods rather than separated into cohesive collaborators or smaller classes. The package contains only this single class, indicating the abstraction has not been further decomposed. Together these factors point to a bloated, insufficiently modular class that would benefit from decomposition."
