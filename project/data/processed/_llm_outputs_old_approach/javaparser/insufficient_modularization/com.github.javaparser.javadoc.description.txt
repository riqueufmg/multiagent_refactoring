      "justification": "Relatively large and complex within the package (9 methods, 71 LOC, WMC=15) and a non-trivial public surface; LCOM=0.222 suggests methods are not perfectly cohesive. It also defines/uses a nested Type and utility behavior (depends on Utils), indicating the class mixes representation and behavior that could be separated."

Its relative size and complexity compared to other classes, together with neutral LCOM=0.0, suggest it aggregates multiple responsibilities that could be decomposed into smaller abstractions."
