It has no fields (nof=0), no children (nc=0) and no incoming/outgoing class-level coupling recorded (fanin=0, fanout=0). The public surface is limited and there is no sign of a bloated interface or high complexity concentrating multiple responsibilities. Package-level coupling (Ca=3) does not imply internal modularization issues for this single, cohesive class."
