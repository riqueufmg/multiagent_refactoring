The combination of multiple fields (nof 5) and many public methods suggests the class exposes a broad set of behaviors and responsibilities related to inference variables that could be decomposed into narrower abstractions."

It has numerous dependencies and appears to centralize method resolution concerns (overloading, matching, inference interactions). Concentrating this much size and functionality in a single class is a strong indicator of insufficient modularization."

Although larger than some classes, its relatively small public interface and focused role (constructor resolution) make it appear cohesive rather than a bloated multi-responsibility class."
