The class lives in a utility/wrapper area (.mvn/wrapper) where responsibilities (downloading, configuration, validation/IO) are often mixed. Relative size and internal complexity (multiple fields and methods bundled into one type) suggest the abstraction has not been decomposed and likely mixes responsibilities that could be split into smaller, more focused classes."

      "detection": true,
      "justification": "Moderately high method count and complexity for this codebase (nom=5, WMC=5, LOC=21) and fewer sibling classes of similar size. The combination of several operations (multiple methods) and a non-trivial WMC suggests the class implements several behaviors (e.g., arithmetic ops, utilities) that could be separated (core numeric representation vs operation helpers). LCOM=0.4 indicates methods are not uniformly cohesive, supporting decomposition."

      "justification": "Although C has 5 methods and WMC=5, its overall size is small (LOC=12) and there are no fields indicating limited state. Methods are likely small and focused; in context of the package (many small test/support classes) this shape fits a compact, cohesive utility/test helper rather than a bloated abstraction, so there is no strong evidence of insufficient modularization."
