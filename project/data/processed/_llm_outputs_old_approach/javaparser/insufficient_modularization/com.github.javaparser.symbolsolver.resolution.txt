      "justification": "The package contains a single class (SymbolSolver) that appears to concentrate many responsibilities: 14 methods (nom=14) with all methods public (nopm=14) indicating a potentially bloated interface; moderate size and complexity (loc=106, wmc=26); numerous and diverse dependencies (reflection model, javaparser model, resolution types, AST Node/Type, contexts, MethodUsage, TypeSolver, etc.), suggesting the class integrates multiple subsystems; package-level efferent coupling is high (Ce=24) while the package has only this class, implying the class holds much of the package's external coupling. Together these points indicate the abstraction has not been sufficiently decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."
