      "justification": "The class is small (LOC 16) with only 2 methods and low cyclomatic complexity (WMC 3). It shows high cohesion (LCOM -1.0) and a minimal public interface (nopm 1). Fan-in and fan-out are 0 and dependencies are minimal, indicating responsibilities are limited and focused. These factors suggest the class is not overly large or handling multiple responsibilities and therefore does not exhibit insufficient modularization."
