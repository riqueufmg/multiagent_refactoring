The combination of high method count and complexity in a compact class suggests multiple responsibilities or a bloated interface (e.g., collection, reporting, resetting of different counters) that could be split into smaller, more focused abstractions. Its role as a statistics aggregator used by Cache further indicates opportunity to decompose responsibilities (counters, snapshots, formatters)."

      "justification": "Cache has a moderate number of methods (nom = 8) and size (loc = 48) with corresponding complexity (wmc = 8). The class appears focused on cache behavior rather than aggregating many unrelated responsibilities. Given its smaller, cohesive footprint and no evidence of an overly broad interface or excessive internal complexity, it does not currently indicate insufficient modularization."
