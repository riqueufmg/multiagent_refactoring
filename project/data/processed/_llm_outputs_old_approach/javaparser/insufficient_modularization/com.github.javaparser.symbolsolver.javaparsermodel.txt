      "class": "JavaParserFactory",
      "detection": true,
      "justification": "Although it has few methods (nom 2), it has high complexity (WMC 49) and relatively large LOC (156), indicating large, complex methods that likely encapsulate multiple tasks that should be decomposed into smaller cohesive units."

      "class": "TypeExtractor",
      "detection": true,
      "justification": "Large and complex: 38 methods, 423 LOC and WMC 128. It handles many different expression and type cases (lots of dependencies), showing a breadth of responsibilities that suggest insufficient decomposition of type-extraction logic."

      "class": "PatternVariableVisitor",
      "detection": false,
      "justification": "Relatively small and purpose-specific: 8 methods, 84 LOC and WMC 16. Dependencies are limited to pattern-related AST nodes, indicating focused visitor behavior rather than a bloated abstraction."
