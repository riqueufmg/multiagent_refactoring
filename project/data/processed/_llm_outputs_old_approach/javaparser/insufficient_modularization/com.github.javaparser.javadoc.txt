The combination of high method count, non-trivial complexity and a broad set of responsibilities suggests a bloated interface and that the abstraction could be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."

Dependencies are limited (Utils and JavadocDescription) and responsibilities appear concentrated on block-tag behavior, so there is no strong evidence of insufficient modularization."
