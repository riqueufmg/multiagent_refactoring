      "justification": "Class 'b' is extremely small and contains no fields or methods (loc=2, nom=0, nof=0, wmc=0). It has no incoming or outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the class does not concentrate responsibilities or have a bloated interface, so there is no evidence of insufficient modularization."
