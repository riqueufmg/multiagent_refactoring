It depends on and aggregates many distinct AST body types (many dependencies listed) and has a high number of children (nc=23), indicating that multiple responsibilities are concentrated in this single abstraction rather than being decomposed."

The metrics suggest a reasonably cohesive single responsibility rather than an under-modularized, multi-responsibility class."
