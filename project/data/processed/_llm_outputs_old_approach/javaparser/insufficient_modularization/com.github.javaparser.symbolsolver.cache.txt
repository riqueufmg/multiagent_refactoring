Although cohesion metric (lcom 0.0) does not imply dispersion, the size and number of public methods suggest multiple responsibilities or feature areas that could be split (e.g., counters, reporting/export, reset/aggregation). This concentration of functionality indicates an opportunity for further modularization."
