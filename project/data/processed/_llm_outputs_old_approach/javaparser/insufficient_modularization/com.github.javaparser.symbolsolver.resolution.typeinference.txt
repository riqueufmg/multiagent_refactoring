The class holds many roles (bound management, processors, variable dependency, instantiation handling) and depends on many types. Concentration of responsibilities and high complexity indicate it should be decomposed into smaller, more focused abstractions (e.g., separate processors, dependency resolver, instantiation manager)."

It appears to mix inference orchestration, constraint handling and interaction with many subsystems — signs of multiple responsibilities that would benefit from modularization."
