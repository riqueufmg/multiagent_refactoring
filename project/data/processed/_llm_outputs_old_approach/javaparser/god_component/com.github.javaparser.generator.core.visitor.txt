    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.generator.core.visitor",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 15 classes and 426 LOC in total, which is moderate and distributed (average ~28 LOC/class). No single class dominates the package (largest class ~56 LOC). Class-level metrics show small, focused generators (low WMC, low LOC) and fan-in/fan-out values are zero for the listed classes. Package coupling indicates Ce=6 (it depends on a few external packages) and Ca=0 (no incoming dependencies), so it is not a central, highly depended-on component. The classes share a clear cohesive purpose (visitor generator variants) rather than many unrelated responsibilities. These factors indicate the package is not excessively large or overly centralized, so it does not qualify as a God Component."
