    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.quality",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class and 40 LOC, which is small and not indicative of an excessively large component. The single class (Preconditions) has 5 methods, LOC 40 and WMC 6, with no outgoing dependencies and no fan-in/fan-out complexity. There is no evidence of a large number of classes or very high LOC that would justify labeling this package a God Component."
