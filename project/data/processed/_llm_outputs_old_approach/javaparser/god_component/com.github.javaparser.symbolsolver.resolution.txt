    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class (num_classes = 1) with 106 LOC, which is not excessively large in terms of lines of code or number of classes. The class SymbolSolver has 14 methods and WMC = 26 (moderate complexity) and low LCOM (0.143) indicating reasonable cohesion. Although the package has several outgoing/incoming dependencies (Ce = 24, Ca = 6), the size metrics (LOC and class count) do not support labeling it a God Component."
