    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 21 classes and 2021 LOC, showing substantial size. Several classes are very large and complex: BoundSet (loc 530, wmc 134, nom 32), TypeInference (loc 277, wmc 69, nom 21), LeastUpperBoundLogic (loc 257, wmc 56, nom 27), TypeHelper (loc 196, wmc 45). Multiple high-WMC, high-LOC classes indicate concentrated complexity and many responsibilities (type inference, bound management, least-upper-bound logic, type helper, control flow logic). The variety of responsibilities combined with the package-level size and complexity supports identification as a God Component."
