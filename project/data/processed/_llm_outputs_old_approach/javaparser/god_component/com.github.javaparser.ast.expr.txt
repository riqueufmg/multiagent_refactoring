    "justification": "The package contains 48 classes and 4,911 LOC, indicating a large component surface. It includes several very large and complex classes (notably Expression: LOC 536, WMC 180, NOM 177, NC 71; ObjectCreationExpr: LOC 238, WMC 62; MethodCallExpr: LOC 220, WMC 61) plus many other classes >100 LOC and high WMC. The package also has substantial coupling (Ca=40 afferent, Ce=14 efferent), showing it is highly central. The combination of high class count, high total LOC, multiple heavyweight classes and strong coupling supports detection of a God Component."
