{
    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "javaparser",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 5 classes and a total of 57 LOC, with the largest class (GenericClass) at 31 LOC and JSONObject at 17 LOC. Method and complexity metrics are low (e.g., wmc 8 for GenericClass, others 5 or 0), and there is no indication of an excessive number of classes or very large source size. Therefore the package is not excessively large and does not exhibit the God Component smell."
