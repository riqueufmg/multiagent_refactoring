    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.cache",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 4 classes and 263 LOC overall, which is not excessively large. The largest class, DefaultCacheStats, is 136 LOC with 19 methods and WMC 20 — notable but not dominating the package — while the other classes (InMemoryCache 44 LOC, GuavaCache 46 LOC, NoCache 37 LOC) are small. Coupled with low package coupling (Ce=1, Ca=1) and no overwhelming number of classes or extreme LOC concentration, there is insufficient evidence to label this package a God Component."
