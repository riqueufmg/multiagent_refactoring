    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 16 classes but a relatively large footprint (loc = 1563) with several very large/complex classes concentrated in it: ClassOrInterfaceType (loc 211, wmc 54, nom 31), Type (loc 206, wmc 67, nom 59, nc 21), ArrayType (loc 196, wmc 38), WildcardType (loc 167, wmc 42), PrimitiveType (loc 137, wmc 29) and TypeParameter (loc 136, wmc 35). Multiple classes have high method counts and high complexity (wmc), indicating concentrated responsibilities. The package also has high afferent coupling (Ca = 28), meaning many other components depend on it, increasing its criticality. Taken together — sizable total LOC, several large/complex classes, concentrated responsibilities in central types, and many incoming dependencies — this fits the contextual definition of a God Component (excessively large component)."
