    "justification": "The package total LOC is 629 but one class, NameLogic, accounts for 599 LOC (~95% of the package), indicating extreme concentration of size and responsibility. NameLogic also has very high complexity (WMC=184), many methods (nom=22) and numerous dependencies, while the other three classes are tiny (loc 23, 4, 3). The package contains only 4 classes, yet almost all functionality and complexity is in a single oversized class, which supports detecting a God Component."
