    "justification": "Package com.foo contains only 1 class and 20 LOC, with low internal complexity (Widget: wmc=3, nom=3, loc=20, lcom=1.0) and no incoming coupling (Ca=0, fanin=0). Although it has several external dependencies (Ce=5), the component is small in size and class count and does not exhibit the excessive size or number of classes characteristic of a God Component."
