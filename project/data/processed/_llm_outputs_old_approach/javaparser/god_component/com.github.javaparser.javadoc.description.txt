    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 5 classes with a total of 186 LOC, which is small for a component. The largest classes are JavadocInlineTag (71 LOC, WMC 15) and JavadocDescription (66 LOC, WMC 18); other classes are much smaller (27 LOC, 16 LOC, 6 LOC). No single class or the package as a whole dominates in size or complexity, and coupling metrics are low (Ce=1, Ca=5). Based on these metrics and contextual judgment, this package does not qualify as a God Component."
