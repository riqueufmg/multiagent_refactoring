    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.cache",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and 106 LOC in total, which is small for a 'God Component'. Individual classes have moderate method counts (CacheStats: 14 methods, LOC 58, WMC 14; Cache: 8 methods, LOC 48, WMC 8) but not an excessive number of classes or overwhelming LOC. Coupling is low (Ce = 0, Ca = 2; class fanin/fanout = 0), so the package is not acting as a highly central/bloated component. Therefore, evidence does not support detection of a God Component."
