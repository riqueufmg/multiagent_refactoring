    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.javasymbolsolver.javassist_symbols.excluded_jar",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 6 LOC, with each class having 3 LOC, no methods (nom = 0), no complexity (wmc = 0), and no inbound/outbound dependencies (fanin/fanout = 0). There is no concentration of functionality or excessive size in terms of classes or lines of code, so it does not qualify as a God Component."
