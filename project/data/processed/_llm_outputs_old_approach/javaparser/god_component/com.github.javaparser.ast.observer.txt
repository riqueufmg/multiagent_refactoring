    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.ast.observer",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes and 276 LOC, which is modest in size and not indicative of an excessively large component. Although ObservableProperty is relatively large (135 LOC, 20 methods, WMC 29 — roughly 49% of the package LOC) and PropagatingAstObserver is notable (70 LOC, WMC 21), the overall package size and class count do not constitute a 'God Component'. The distribution shows a couple of larger classes rather than an overwhelmingly large component in terms of total LOC or number of classes, so the available data do not support flagging this package as a God Component."
