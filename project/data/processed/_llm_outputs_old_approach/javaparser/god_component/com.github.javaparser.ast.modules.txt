    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.ast.modules",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes and a total of 835 LOC (average ≈119 LOC/class), which is moderate in size and not excessively large in either lines of code or class count. No single class dominates the package: the largest class (ModuleDeclaration/ModuleDirective area) has ~131–144 LOC and the highest method count shown (nom 44) but this is not disproportionate compared to other classes (most classes are 91–144 LOC and have similar complexity measures). Fan-in/fan-out values are zero for individual classes and package coupling (Ce=6, Ca=8) is modest. The package is organized around distinct module directive types (Provides, Requires, Uses, Opens, Exports, Declaration, Directive), indicating responsibilities are separated rather than concentrated in a single oversized component. Therefore the available data do not support labeling this package as a God Component."
