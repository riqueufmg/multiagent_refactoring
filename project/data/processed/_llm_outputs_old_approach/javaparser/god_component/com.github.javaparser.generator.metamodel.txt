    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.generator.metamodel",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 5 classes totaling 369 LOC, with the largest class (MetaModelGenerator) at 185 LOC. Other classes are small (75, 36, 38, 35 LOC). No extreme concentration of size or responsibilities is evident: work is distributed across multiple helper generators rather than a single overwhelmingly large class. Additionally, the package has no incoming coupling (Ca=0) and modest outgoing coupling (Ce=6), and class-level metrics (wmc, nom) are moderate. Based on these metrics and the distribution of LOC and classes, there is insufficient evidence to label this package a God Component."
