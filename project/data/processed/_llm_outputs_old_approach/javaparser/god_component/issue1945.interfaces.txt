    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package issue1945.interfaces contains only 3 classes and 20 total LOC (num_classes=3, loc=20). The largest class, HairTypeRenderer, is 14 LOC with low complexity (wmc=2); the other classes HairType and HairyAnimal are 3 LOC each with wmc=1. Package coupling is minimal (Ce=0, Ca=2) and there are no large files or high method counts. These metrics indicate the component is small and not excessively large, so it does not qualify as a God Component."
