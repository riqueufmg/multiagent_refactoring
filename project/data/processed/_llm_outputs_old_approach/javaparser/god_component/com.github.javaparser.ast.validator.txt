    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.ast.validator",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 10 classes and 190 total LOC (average ~19 LOC/class), with the largest classes at ~30 LOC (Validators 30 LOC, ProblemReporter 28 LOC, RecordAsTypeIdentifierNotAllowed 28 LOC). Individual class complexity (WMC) is low to moderate (max WMC ~7), and no class shows extreme size or high fanin/fanout. Given the modest total LOC, small per-class sizes, and limited number of classes, the package is not excessively large and does not qualify as a God Component."
