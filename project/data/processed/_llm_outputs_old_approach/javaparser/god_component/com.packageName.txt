    "justification": "The package contains 4 classes and 35 LOC in total, which is small and not excessive. Individual classes have low LOC (13, 11, 6, 5), minimal numbers of methods (most nom = 0 or 1), and very low complexity metrics (wmc = 0 or 1). There is no high fan-in/fan-out or large number of responsibilities indicated. Based on these metrics, the component is not excessively large and does not qualify as a God Component."
