    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.testpackage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class and 6 lines of code (num_classes=1, loc=6). The single class has low complexity and size (loc=6, wmc=2, nom=2) and no incoming or outgoing dependencies (Ca=0, Ce=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). These metrics indicate the component is very small and not excessively large, so it does not qualify as a God Component."
