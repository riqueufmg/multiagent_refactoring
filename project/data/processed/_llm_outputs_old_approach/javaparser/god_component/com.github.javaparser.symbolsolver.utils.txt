    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.utils",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 4 classes totaling 165 LOC, which is not excessively large. The largest class, SymbolSolverCollectionStrategy, is 71 LOC with moderate complexity (wmc 22, nom 7); the other classes are small (45, 38, 11 LOC). There is no unusually high number of classes, no very large LOC concentration, and no high fan-in indicating a central monolithic component, so the package does not meet the contextual criteria for a God Component."
