    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.resolution.model",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and a total of 143 LOC (class LOCs: 71, 44, 28). No single class dominates the package size, and per-class complexity (WMCs 11, 10, 5) and cohesion figures do not indicate an excessively large or centralized component. Although the package has moderate incoming coupling (Ca = 16), the absolute size in lines and number of classes is small, so there is no evidence of a 'God Component' based on the provided data."
