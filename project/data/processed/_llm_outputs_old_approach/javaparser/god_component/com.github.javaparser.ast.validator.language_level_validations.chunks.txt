    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes and 359 LOC in total, which is moderate and not excessively large for a package. Although ModifierValidator is relatively large (168 LOC, 18 methods, WMC 44) and could be a candidate for class-level refactoring, the other six classes are small (LOCs: 41, 32, 73, 15, 15, 15) with low complexity. The class-and-LOC distribution shows a single outlier rather than an overall oversized component, so the package as a whole does not meet the contextual criteria for a God Component."
