    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 10 LOC (each class 5 LOC). Class metrics show minimal complexity (wmc=1), no coupling (Ce=0, Ca=0, fanin=0, fanout=0), and no large number of methods or fields. Given the very small size and low complexity, there is no evidence of an excessively large component."
