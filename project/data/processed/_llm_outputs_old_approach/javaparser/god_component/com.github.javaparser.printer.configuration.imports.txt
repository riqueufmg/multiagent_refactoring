    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 3 classes with a total of 99 LOC (class LOC: 16, 34, 49). Individual classes have low-to-moderate complexity (WMC 4, 7, 10), no reported coupling (fanin/fanout 0) and limited external dependencies (com.github.javaparser.ast and NodeList). Given the small number of classes, low LOC and limited coupling, the component is not excessively large and does not exhibit a God Component smell."
