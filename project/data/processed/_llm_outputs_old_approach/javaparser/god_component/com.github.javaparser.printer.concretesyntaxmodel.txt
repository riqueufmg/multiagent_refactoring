    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 18 classes and 588 LOC, which is moderate rather than excessively large. Most classes are small (many < 50 LOC); only a few classes concentrate more size/complexity (e.g. CsmElement: 90 LOC with 30 methods, CsmList: 82 LOC, CsmToken: 63 LOC). Package coupling is low (Ce=7, Ca=3) and fan-in/fan-out values per class are minimal, indicating focused responsibility. While one class (CsmElement) shows concentrated complexity and could be refactored, the package as a whole does not present the excessive size in LOC or class count that would justify labeling it a God Component."
