    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 16 classes with a total of 1848 LOC, and a small subset of classes concentrates most of the size and complexity. Notably: ReflectionInterfaceDeclaration (312 LOC, WMC 70, NOM 38), ReflectionRecordDeclaration (257 LOC, WMC 72, NOM 39), ReflectionClassDeclaration (223 LOC, WMC 64, NOM 35), ReflectionClassAdapter (149 LOC, WMC 41, NOM 14), ReflectionEnumDeclaration (149 LOC, WMC 40, NOM 23), ReflectionAnnotationDeclaration (118 LOC, WMC 30, NOM 22), ReflectionFactory (96 LOC, WMC 27, NOM 3) and ReflectionMethodDeclaration (84 LOC, WMC 25, NOM 19). These 8 classes (half the package) account for roughly 75% of the package LOC, and several have high method counts and complexity (high NOM and WMC), indicating concentrated responsibilities. The package also has numerous external couplings (Ce = 21, Ca = 9), reflecting many dependencies. Taken together, the size concentration and high internal complexity support detecting a God Component smell for this package."
