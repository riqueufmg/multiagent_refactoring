    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "foo.bar.differentpackage",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 8 LOC, with very low complexity metrics (wmc=0, nof=2 per class, loc per class=4), minimal coupling (Ce=1, Ca=0) and no significant fan-in/fan-out. These values indicate the component is small and not excessively large, so it does not qualify as a God Component."
