    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.printer.configuration",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 9 classes and 452 LOC, which is moderate in size. While a few classes hold most of the code (PrettyPrinterConfiguration: 170 LOC, Indentation: 69 LOC, DefaultPrinterConfiguration: 65 LOC, DefaultConfigurationOption: 62 LOC), the package is split into multiple classes (no single overwhelmingly large class) and has low coupling (Ce=2, Ca=5). The concentration of functionality in several related classes appears expected for printer configuration concerns and does not by itself indicate an excessively large component, so there is insufficient evidence to mark this package as a God Component."
