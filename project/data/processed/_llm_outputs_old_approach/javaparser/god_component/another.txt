    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "another",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package 'another' contains 6 classes but only 11 total LOC, with individual class LOC mostly 1–2 and metrics showing WMC=0, NC=0 for classes. Package-level coupling is Ce=0 and Ca=0 and there are no dependencies. Given the very small size (LOC) and low complexity of all classes, there is no evidence of an excessively large component, so it is not a God Component."
