    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package's size and responsibility are highly concentrated in a single class: JavaSymbolSolver has 324 LOC out of the package's 480 LOC (~67%), 15 methods (12 public), and a very high WMC of 88, indicating high complexity. It also depends on many resolution and AST types (long dependency list), suggesting it centralizes many responsibilities. The package contains only 3 classes, so the component's behaviour and complexity are dominated by one large class — a clear sign of a God Component."
