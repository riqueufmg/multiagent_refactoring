    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains very large classes concentrated in a single component: total package LOC = 12,688 while each of the four class entries named 'Ops' is ~3,172 LOC. Each 'Ops' class has ~313 methods (nom = 313) and high complexity (wmc = 313), indicating a single class that implements a very large portion of functionality. The package therefore exhibits an excessive size concentrated in one component, consistent with the God Component smell."
