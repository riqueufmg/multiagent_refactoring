    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.typeinference.bounds",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 5 classes and 210 LOC in total, with individual class sizes of 60, 57, 39, 33 and 21 LOC. No single class or the package as a whole is excessively large by contextual judgment (no very high LOC or large number of classes). Complexity metrics (WMC values: 17,16,11,9,5) are moderate and fan-in/fan-out are zero for these classes. Therefore there is no evidence that this component is a God Component."
