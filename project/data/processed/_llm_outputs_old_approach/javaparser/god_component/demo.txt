    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "demo",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes and 111 LOC overall, which is not excessively large. Individual classes are small (three Main classes ~31 LOC each, three Main.Callback classes ~6 LOC each) with low complexity (Main wmc=4, Callback wmc=0) and no notable inheritance depth or cohesion issues. Coupling is low (Ce=1, Ca=0, fanin/fanout mostly 0). The apparent class count is largely due to duplicated small test variants rather than a single bloated component. Therefore the package does not exhibit the characteristics of a God Component."
