    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "bar",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package 'bar' contains only 1 class and 2 lines of code (package.metrics: num_classes=1, loc=2). The single class 'A' has loc=2, wmc=0, nc=0, fanin=0, fanout=0 and no dependencies. These metrics indicate the component is minimal rather than excessively large, so it does not meet the contextual criteria for a God Component."
