    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.ast.body",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 18 classes with a total of 3034 LOC, indicating substantial size for a single component. Several classes are individually large and complex (examples: CallableDeclaration LOC 293, WMC 71; BodyDeclaration LOC 211, NOM 62, WMC 70; CompactConstructorDeclaration LOC 237, WMC 59; MethodDeclaration LOC 228, NOM 39, WMC 61; Parameter LOC 221, WMC 55). The package also has high afferent coupling (Ca = 41), showing many other components depend on it, and multiple classes expose many methods (high NOM) and high complexity (high WMC). Together these factors (large aggregate LOC, many sizable/complex classes, and high external dependency) support classifying this package as a God Component."
