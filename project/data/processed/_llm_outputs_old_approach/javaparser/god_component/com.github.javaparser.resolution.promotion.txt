    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package is very small: num_classes = 1 and total loc = 3. The single class (ConditionalExprHandler) has loc = 3, wmc = 1, and nc = 3, indicating minimal complexity. A God Component is characterized by being excessively large in LOC or number of classes; this package is tiny and has low coupling metrics (Ce = 1, Ca = 2 and fanin/fanout = 0), so there is no evidence of an overly large or monolithic component."
