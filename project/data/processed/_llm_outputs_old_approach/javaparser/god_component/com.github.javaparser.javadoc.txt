    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.javadoc",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and 216 total LOC, which is modest in size. The largest class (Javadoc) is 113 LOC with 14 methods and WMC 23 — nontrivial but not excessively large; other classes are 84 LOC and 19 LOC respectively. Cohesion metrics (LCOM = 0.0) indicate focused responsibilities, and fanin/fanout values are 0 for classes provided, showing limited coupling. Given the small number of classes, moderate LOC per class, and evidence of cohesion, the package does not exhibit the excessive size or scope characteristic of a God Component."
