    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.utils",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 34 classes and 2,501 LOC, indicating substantial size for a single component. Several classes are individually large and complex (SourceRoot: 453 LOC, nom 40, wmc 59; StringEscapeUtils: 257 LOC; Utils: 230 LOC, nom 26, wmc 53; VisitorList: 175 LOC, nom 37, wmc 48; plus multiple other non-trivial classes). The package also has high incoming coupling (Ca = 42), showing it is a central, heavily used component. The combination of many classes, high total LOC, multiple large high-complexity classes with many methods, and strong coupling supports the judgement that this package functions as a God Component."
