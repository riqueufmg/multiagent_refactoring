    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class (DefaultStrategy) with 117 LOC and 15 methods — not an excessively large number of classes nor an extreme LOC that would indicate a package-level God Component. Although the class has a relatively high WMC (26) and LCOM ~0.93 (suggesting some complexity and low cohesion), the component is small in terms of class count and overall size, and has no incoming/outgoing package-level dependencies (Ca and Ce = 0). These factors do not support labeling the package as a God Component."
