    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "japa.bdd.samples",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package has 12 classes and 430 LOC but a single class (JavaConcepts) dominates with 299 LOC (~70% of package LOC), 9 methods and a WMC of 23, indicating concentrated size and complexity. Many small types (Ugly, Teste, Sexo, Enum, QWE, A, etc.) are declared in the same file, suggesting one oversized component holding multiple responsibilities. The package also shows low external coupling (Ce=1, Ca=0), meaning the bulk of functionality is internal to this package. Together these facts support that the package contains a God Component (excessively large/central class)."
