    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 17 classes but only 134 total LOC (≈8 LOC per class). Most classes are trivial JavaXXPostProcessor files with LOC = 5; the only larger files are PostProcessors (LOC 30, WMC 7) and Java10PostProcessor (LOC 29, WMC 4). There is no single class or concentrated subset that is excessively large in LOC or complexity, and coupling indicators are low (Ce = 2, Ca = 1, fanin/fanout mostly 0). Based on these elements, the package does not exhibit a God Component smell."
