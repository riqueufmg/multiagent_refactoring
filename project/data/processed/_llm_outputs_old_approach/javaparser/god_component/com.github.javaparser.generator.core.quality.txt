    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class (num_classes = 1) with 93 LOC. The class NotNullGenerator has modest complexity (wmc = 18, nom = 8) and no incoming coupling (Ca = 0, fanin = 0). There is no evidence of an excessive number of classes or an unusually large amount of code concentrated in this package, so it does not meet the contextual criteria for a God Component."
