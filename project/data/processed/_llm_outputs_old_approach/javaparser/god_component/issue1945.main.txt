    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package issue1945.main contains a single class (num_classes=1) with 28 LOC and one field. The class MainIssue1945 shows 6 methods (nom=6), WMC=6 and no significant coupling (fanin=0, fanout=0 at class level, package Ca=0). There is no evidence of excessive size in lines of code or an unusually large number of classes; dependencies are minimal. Based on these metrics, this component is not excessively large and does not qualify as a God Component."
