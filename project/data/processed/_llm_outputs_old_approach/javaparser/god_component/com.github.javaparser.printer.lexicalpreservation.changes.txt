    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.printer.lexicalpreservation.changes",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes and a total of 170 LOC, which is modest and not indicative of an excessively large component. Individual classes are small (LOCs: 11, 28, 20, 35, 41, 35) and responsibilities appear distributed across purpose-specific classes (NoChange, PropertyChange, Change, ListAdditionChange, ListRemovalChange, ListReplacementChange). Complexity metrics (maximum WMC = 9, modest NOM values) and the absence of a single class dominating LOC or methods indicate no single god component. Coupling (Ce = 6, Ca = 1) is present but not extreme. Based on these elements, the package does not qualify as a God Component."
