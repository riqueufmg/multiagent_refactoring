    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package a.b.c has 6 classes and a total of 26 LOC — not an excessive size. Individual classes are very small (LOC values: 2, 9, 2, 2, 9, 2) with low complexity (WMC 0 or 2) and minimal coupling (fanin/fanout 0, Ce/Ca = 0). There is no sign of a single oversized component concentrating functionality, so the package does not qualify as a God Component."
