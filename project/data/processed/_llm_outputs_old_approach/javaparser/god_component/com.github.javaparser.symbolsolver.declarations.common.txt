    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.declarations.common",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains a single class and is small in size (package LOC = 55; num_classes = 1). The sole class MethodDeclarationCommonLogic is 55 LOC with moderate complexity (WMC = 13, NOM = 5) but not an excessively large implementation. Although efferent coupling (Ce = 10) indicates it depends on several other packages, the smell definition targets excessive size (LOC or many classes), which is not met here. Therefore this package does not qualify as a God Component."
