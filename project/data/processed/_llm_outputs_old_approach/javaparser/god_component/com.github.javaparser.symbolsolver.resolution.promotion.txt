    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.symbolsolver.resolution.promotion",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 4 classes and 101 LOC overall, which is modest in size and not excessively large. The largest class (NumericConditionalExprHandler) is 58 LOC with WMC 15; the remaining classes are small (14–17 LOC, WMC 3–4). Fan-in and fan-out values are zero for these classes and package-level afferent/efferent counts are low (Ca=1, Ce=3), indicating limited coupling. Given the small number of classes, moderate LOC, and absence of high coupling or extremely large/complex classes, there is insufficient evidence to consider this package a God Component."
