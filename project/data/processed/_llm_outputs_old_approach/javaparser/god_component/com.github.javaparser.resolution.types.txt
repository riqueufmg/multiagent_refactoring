    "justification": "The package contains 12 classes and 1040 LOC with a strong concentration of size and complexity in a few classes: ResolvedReferenceType (loc 377, nom 51, wmc 100), ResolvedType (loc 128, nom 29, wmc 30), ResolvedPrimitiveType (loc 128, nom 21, wmc 39), and ResolvedWildcard (loc 125, nom 20, wmc 39). Those four classes account for the majority (~73%) of the package LOC and exhibit high method counts and cognitive complexity, indicating the component is handling many responsibilities and is excessively large for a single package."
