    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.github.javaparser.ast.visitor",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 18 classes but an extremely large total size (loc = 11,816) with several very large classes concentrated in it. Notable examples: NodeFinderVisitor (loc=1868, wmc=648), GenericListVisitorAdapter (loc=1803, wmc=561), GenericVisitorAdapter (loc=1707, wmc=563), CloneVisitor (loc=1082), ModifierVisitor (loc=1049), EqualsVisitor (loc=848), and multiple other classes in the 300–700+ LOC range. Many classes also declare ~100 methods (nom ≈ 100) and very high WMC values, indicating high internal complexity and multiple responsibilities. The combination of very high LOC, many large classes, high method counts and complexity concentrated in this single package supports the contextual judgement that this package is a God Component."
