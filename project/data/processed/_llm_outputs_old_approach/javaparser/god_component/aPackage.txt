    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 10 LOC (each class 5 LOC). Per-class metrics show very low complexity (WMC=1), no fields/methods beyond minimal (nom=1, nopm=1), and no coupling (Ce=0, Ca=0, fanin=0, fanout=0). Given the small size and lack of complexity or many classes, there is no evidence of an excessively large component."
