    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 37 classes and 2,856 LOC, indicating substantial size. Several classes are very large and complex (ByteBuddyAndroidPlugin: 528 LOC; ByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask: 313 LOC, WMC 25; ByteBuddyAndroidService: 292 LOC, WMC 26; ByteBuddyAndroidTaskExtension: 228 LOC, WMC 23; LegacyByteBuddyLocalClassesEnhancerTask: 153 LOC, WMC 17; Transformation: 103 LOC, WMC 11; ByteBuddyAndroidService.State: 101 LOC). Multiple inner/auxiliary classes are embedded in the same package/class files, and the package aggregates responsibilities for plugin, tasks, service and transformation logic. The concentration of large, high-complexity classes and many responsibilities in this single package supports the identification of a God Component."
