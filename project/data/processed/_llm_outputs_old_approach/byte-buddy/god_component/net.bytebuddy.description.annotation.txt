    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package net.bytebuddy.description.annotation is excessively large in context: it contains 49 classes and 9,225 lines of code, concentrated in a few very large classes/files. Notable examples include AnnotationValue (~2,457 LOC) with many inner types, AnnotationDescription (~1,151 LOC), AnnotationValue.ForConstant (~730 LOC), AnnotationValue.PropertyDelegate (~392 LOC), AnnotationDescription.Builder (~390 LOC) and AnnotationList (~307 LOC). Multiple large inner classes are defined in the same files, suggesting high functional concentration. Given the large aggregate LOC, high class count and several individual classes/files that are very large, this package exhibits the God Component smell."
