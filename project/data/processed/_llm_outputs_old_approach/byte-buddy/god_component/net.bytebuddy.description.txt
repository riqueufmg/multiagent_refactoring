    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.description",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 28 classes and 1,656 LOC, an average of ~59 LOC per class; while a few classes/files are relatively large (ModifierReviewable entries sum to ~825 LOC across nested types, TypeVariableSource ~118 LOC, ByteCodeElement ~103 LOC), the overall package size is moderate and the classes are thematically cohesive (named/bytecode/modifier description abstractions). Coupling metrics are also moderate (Ce=4, Ca=12), suggesting the package is not an overwhelmingly large, monolithic component dominating the system. Therefore, based on the provided data and contextual judgement, this package does not qualify as a God Component."
