    "justification": "The package contains 69 classes and 8,542 LOC, which is large for a single component and indicates aggregation of many responsibilities. Several very large classes concentrate much of that size: JavaConstant alone is ~1,907 LOC with many inner types (MethodHandle, MethodType, Dynamic, Simple, Visitor, Dispatcher, etc.), JavaConstant.Dynamic ~408 LOC, JavaConstant.MethodHandle ~522 LOC, AsmClassWriter ~514 LOC, AsmClassReader ~331 LOC and multiple other classes >150 LOC (JavaModule 238 LOC, JavaType 186 LOC). The presence of many sizable classes and numerous nested/inner types within the same package, plus broad dependencies to and from other packages, suggests this package is doing excessive work and acts as a god component."
