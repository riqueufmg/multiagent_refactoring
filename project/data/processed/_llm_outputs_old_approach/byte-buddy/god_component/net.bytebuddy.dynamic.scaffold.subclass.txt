    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.scaffold.subclass",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 9 classes and 812 LOC, with the largest class (ConstructorStrategy) at 256 LOC and other sizable classes at 158, 106 and 104 LOC. While some classes are non-trivial, the overall class count (9) and total LOC (812) are moderate and the functionality is split into clearly named responsibilities (ConstructorStrategy variants, SubclassImplementationTarget, SubclassDynamicTypeBuilder, factories and small inner types). Complexity metrics (WMC values generally low, LCOM values indicating cohesion) and the presence of multiple focused classes suggest the package is modular rather than a single excessively large God Component."
