    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 27 classes and 1,317 LOC, but the majority of classes are small (most ~46 LOC, many in the 46–90 LOC range), giving an average of ~49 LOC/class. Only one file (ModifierContributor) is notably larger (~204 LOC) and several inner types are declared there, but overall method complexity (wmc) values are low across classes and fanin/fanout are zero for most types. The package appears cohesive (all classes model modifier-related concepts) and has low efferent coupling (Ce=1) with modest afferent coupling (Ca=16). Given the distribution of size and low internal complexity, the component is not excessively large in this context and does not meet the contextual criteria for a God Component."
