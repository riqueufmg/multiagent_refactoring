    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package is excessively large and concentrated: 168 classes and 36,243 LOC overall, indicating a very large component. Several individual classes are extremely large (examples: TypeWriter ~4,701 LOC; TypeWriter.Default ~3,402 LOC; MethodGraph ~1,553 LOC; InstrumentedType ~1,502 LOC; TypeWriter.ValidatingClassVisitor ~1,255 LOC; MethodRegistry ~776 LOC), and there are many additional sizable inner/auxiliary classes (multiple TypeWriter and MethodGraph inner types exceeding hundreds of LOC). This concentration of functionality and high LOC across many classes (including many classes >1k LOC) suggests the package is doing too much, harming cohesion and maintainability — consistent with the God Component smell."
