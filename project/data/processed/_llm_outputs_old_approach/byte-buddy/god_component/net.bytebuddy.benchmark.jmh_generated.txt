    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.jmh_generated",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 59 classes and 11,019 LOC, which indicates substantial size for a single component. Many classes are relatively large and complex (numerous jmhTest classes with ~275 LOC and WMC=42 repeated across the package), giving an average of ~186 LOC per class and a concentration of complexity in multiple files. Additionally, the package has no external afferent/emanent couplings (Ca=0, Ce=0), suggesting the functionality is self-contained rather than split across modules. These elements (high total LOC, large number of classes, multiple high-complexity/large classes) support detecting a God Component smell for this package."
