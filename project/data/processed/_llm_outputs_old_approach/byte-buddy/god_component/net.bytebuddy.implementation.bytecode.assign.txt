    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.assign",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes and 238 LOC total (average ~40 LOC/class), with the largest class (Assigner) at 95 LOC. Class-level metrics (low WMCs, small LOCs, low method counts) do not indicate an excessively large or complex component. Coupling (Ce=5, Ca=12) is moderate but does not by itself imply a God Component. Based on the provided size and complexity data, this package is not excessively large and therefore not a God Component."
