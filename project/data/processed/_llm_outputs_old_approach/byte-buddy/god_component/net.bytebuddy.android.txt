    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.android",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 17 classes but a concentrated amount of code (2012 LOC) is clustered in a single component file (AndroidClassLoadingStrategy.java). The top-level AndroidClassLoadingStrategy alone is 654 LOC and hosts many nested/related classes recorded in the same file (DexProcessor 279 LOC, ForSdkCompiler 252 LOC, Injecting 172 LOC, Dispatcher 140 LOC, plus multiple smaller inner classes). This concentration of sizable classes and responsibilities in one component/file indicates the package has an excessively large, central component handling many concerns, consistent with the God Component smell."
