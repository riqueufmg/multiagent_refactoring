    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.specimen",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and 298 LOC, with code distributed across ExampleClass (167 LOC, 18 methods, WMC 18) and ExampleInterface (131 LOC, 18 methods, WMC 18). There is no evidence of excessive class count or a single overwhelmingly large class — sizes are moderate and balanced. Coupling is very low (package Ce=0, Ca=1, class fanin/fanout=0), and there are no dependencies indicating a central, highly connected component. Given this context, the data do not support labeling this package as a God Component."
