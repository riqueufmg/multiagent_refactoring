    "justification": "The package is excessively large: 411 classes and 81,157 LOC in a single package. Multiple individual classes/nested types contain extremely large bodies (example metrics): Advice (~11,101 LOC), MemberSubstitution (~6,597 LOC), MemberSubstitution.Substitution (~4,607 LOC), MemberSubstitution.Chain (~4,143 LOC), MemberSubstitution.Step (~4,013 LOC), Advice.Dispatcher (~2,415 LOC), Advice.OffsetMapping (~3,434 LOC), MemberSubstitution.OffsetMapping (~2,356 LOC), ClassVisitorFactory (~971 LOC), Advice.StackMapFrameHandler (~941 LOC). The size is concentrated in many very large classes/nested types rather than being evenly distributed, indicating a single component that owns a disproportionate amount of code and responsibility. These facts support detection of the God Component smell for net.bytebuddy.asm."
