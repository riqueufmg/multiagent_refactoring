    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 44 classes and 3,359 LOC, which is large for a single package. Several classes are particularly large and concentrate responsibilities: AnnotationAppender (556 LOC), MethodAttributeAppender (338 LOC), TypeAttributeAppender (164 LOC), FieldAttributeAppender (175 LOC), and RecordComponentAttributeAppender (175 LOC). Many files define multiple inner/variant classes (e.g., AnnotationAppender, MethodAttributeAppender, FieldAttributeAppender) indicating a concentration of varied behavior in the same package. This combination of high class count, high total LOC and multiple very large classes suggests the package is excessively large and fulfils the characteristics of a God Component."
