    "justification": "The package contains 73 classes and 5,083 LOC with a strong concentration of size and complexity in a few files. In particular, ElementMatchers alone accounts for 1,785 LOC, ~198 methods (nom) and a very high WMC (207), indicating it centralizes a large portion of behavior. Additional relatively large classes include LatentMatcher (240 LOC, many nested types), ModifierMatcher (136 LOC), StringMatcher (132 LOC) and FilterableList (111 LOC). The presence of one dominant, highly complex class together with several medium-sized classes within the same package indicates the package functions as an excessively large component (responsibility concentration), supporting the detection of a God Component."
