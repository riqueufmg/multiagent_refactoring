    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 28 classes and 1,768 LOC, which is large for a single package and suggests many responsibilities concentrated in one component. Several classes are particularly large and complex: MethodConstant (388 LOC, WMC 20), IntegerConstant (155 LOC, WMC 14), and ClassConstant (139 LOC, WMC 13). There are multiple additional classes in the 70–90 LOC range and many nested/auxiliary types (inner classes), indicating complexity and responsibility clustering. The combination of high class count, total LOC and concentrated complexity supports detecting a God Component."
