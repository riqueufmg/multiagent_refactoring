    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 186 LOC (each class ~93 LOC). Neither the number of classes nor the total LOC indicate an excessively large component. Class complexity (WMC=12) is moderate and coupling is low (fanin/fanout=0). Based on these elements, the package does not meet the contextual criteria for a God Component."
