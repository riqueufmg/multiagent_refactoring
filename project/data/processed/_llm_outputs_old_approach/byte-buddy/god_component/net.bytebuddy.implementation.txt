    "justification": "The package is excessively large: 264 classes and 32,056 LOC concentrated in a single package. It contains numerous very large classes (examples: MethodCall 2,648 LOC; InvokeDynamic 2,217 LOC; Implementation 1,761 LOC; MethodDelegation 1,134 LOC; Implementation.Context 1,133 LOC; MethodCall.ArgumentLoader 794 LOC; FieldAccessor 1,020 LOC; EqualsMethod 843 LOC; HashCodeMethod 641 LOC; ToStringMethod 605 LOC). Several classes exceed 1,000+ LOC and multiple exceed 2,000 LOC, indicating a concentration of responsibilities. The high class count combined with many large classes and many nested/inner types within the same package supports a contextual judgment that this package functions as a God Component."
