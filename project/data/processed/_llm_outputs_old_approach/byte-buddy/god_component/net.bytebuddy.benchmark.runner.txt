    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.benchmark.runner",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only one class (num_classes=1) with 23 lines of code (loc=23). The single class QuickRunner has low complexity (wmc=2), few methods (nom=2), minimal public fields/methods (nof=1, nopf=0, nopm=1), and no incoming/outgoing dependencies (fanin=0, fanout=0). There is no evidence of an excessively large component by LOC or by number of classes, so the God Component smell is not present."
