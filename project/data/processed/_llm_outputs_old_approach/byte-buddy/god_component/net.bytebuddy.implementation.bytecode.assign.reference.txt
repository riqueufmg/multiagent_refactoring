    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package holds 9 classes with a total of 976 LOC, indicating substantial size for a single component. Two classes within it are very large: GenericTypeAwareAssigner (loc 360) and GenericTypeAwareAssigner.IsAssignableToVisitor (loc 336), which together account for ~700 LOC — a strong concentration of implementation in a few artifacts. Several other nested/inner variants are present in the same compilation unit, suggesting that multiple responsibilities are collocated. Although the package's class count (9) is moderate, the high LOC concentrated in a small number of classes and nested types supports identifying this package as a God Component."
