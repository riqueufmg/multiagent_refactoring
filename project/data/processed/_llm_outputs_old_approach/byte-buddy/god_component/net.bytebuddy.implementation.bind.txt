    "justification": "The package contains 32 classes and 2,628 LOC, indicating substantial size. A large portion of functionality is concentrated in single large sources: MethodDelegationBinder.java alone is 777 LOC and defines many nested types (MethodBinding 174 LOC, ParameterBinding 127 LOC, AmbiguityResolver 146 LOC, Builder 126 LOC, etc.). ArgumentTypeResolver is another large class (203 LOC). The concentration of many responsibilities and substantial lines of code in a few files (especially MethodDelegationBinder and its many inner classes) supports the detection of a God Component."
