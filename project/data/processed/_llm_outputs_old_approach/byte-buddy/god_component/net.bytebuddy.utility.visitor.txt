    "justification": "The package totals 993 LOC spread over 6 classes but the size and complexity are highly concentrated in a few classes: MetadataAwareClassVisitor (loc 332, nom 39, wmc 44), StackAwareMethodVisitor (loc 318, nom 24, wmc 84) and ExceptionTableSensitiveMethodVisitor (loc 237, nom 35, wmc 36). These three classes alone account for ~887 LOC (~89% of the package), with very high numbers of methods and high cyclomatic complexity (wmc), indicating multiple responsibilities concentrated in a small set of components. This concentration of LOC, methods and complexity supports detection of a God Component in this package."
