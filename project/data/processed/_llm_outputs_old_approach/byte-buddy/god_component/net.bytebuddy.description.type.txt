    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package is excessively large: 175 classes and 33,551 LOC, which indicates concentration of many responsibilities in a single component. Multiple individual types are very large (e.g. TypeDescription: 8,174 LOC; TypeDescription.Generic: 5,738 LOC; TypeDescription.ForLoadedType variants and large inner types such as Builder: 583 LOC, LazyProjection: 597 LOC, TypeList: 844 LOC, RecordComponentList: 232 LOC). The package also contains many nested/inner classes and wide external dependencies, showing high coupling and large surface area. Taken together (very high total LOC, high class count, and several very large classes), these elements justify flagging this package as a God Component."
