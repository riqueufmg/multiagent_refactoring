    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains an unusually large amount of code and classes: 118 classes and ~14,892 LOC concentrated in a single package. Several very large classes/files indicate aggregation of many responsibilities in the package (ClassInjector ~2245 LOC, ByteArrayClassLoader ~1127 LOC, ClassLoadingStrategy ~450 LOC, ClassReloadingStrategy ~430 LOC, ModuleLayerFromSingleClassLoaderDecorator ~407 LOC). Many nested/inner types are defined in the same files and there are high complexity/size hotspots (e.g. ByteArrayClassLoader WMC=30). The combination of high LOC, high class count and multiple large, complex classes handling distinct concerns (class injection, class loading strategies, module layer handling, reloading, etc.) supports identifying net.bytebuddy.dynamic.loading as a God Component."
