    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and a total of 38 LOC, with the largest class being 16 LOC. Class-level metrics show very low complexity (WMC ≤ 2) and no large number of methods or fields. External couplings are minimal (Ce=1, Ca=1) and no single class or the package as a whole shows excessive size or concentration of functionality that would indicate a God Component."
