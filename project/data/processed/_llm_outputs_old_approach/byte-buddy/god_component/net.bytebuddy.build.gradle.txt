    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 42 classes and 3,915 LOC, indicating substantial size and surface area. Several classes concentrate most of the complexity and lines: AbstractByteBuddyTask (474 LOC, WMC 50), AbstractByteBuddyTaskExtension (360 LOC, WMC 41), ByteBuddyPlugin (314 LOC), Transformation (221 LOC), and Adjustment (177 LOC). Multiple large classes with high WMC and many inner/related classes (numerous nested types listed) show concentrated responsibilities and complexity within this single package. The combination of high total LOC, large individual classes, and concentrated complexity supports identifying this package as a God Component."
