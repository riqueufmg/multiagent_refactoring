    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.bytecode.collection",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 10 classes and 675 LOC (average ~67.5 LOC/class), which is moderate rather than excessively large. The largest files are ArrayFactory (235 LOC), ArrayAccess (136 LOC) and ArrayFactory.ArrayCreator (107 LOC), indicating a few localized hotspots but no single class or the package as a whole overwhelmingly dominates size. Complexity hotspots (WMC = 14) exist for ArrayFactory and ArrayAccess, but the package's external coupling is low (Ce = 4, Ca = 1) and responsibilities appear focused on collection/array-related bytecode generation. Given the distribution of LOC and limited coupling, the data do not support classifying this package as a God Component."
