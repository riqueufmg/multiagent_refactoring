    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.implementation.auxiliary",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 26 classes and 1,979 LOC, with a clear concentration of size and responsibility in a few large classes: TypeProxy (450 LOC, 38 members) and MethodCallProxy (279 LOC, 12 members). Several files define multiple nested/inner types (e.g., AuxiliaryType and TypeProxy), increasing single-component complexity. The LOC distribution is skewed (average ~76 LOC/class) but concentrated in these large classes and many small helpers, indicating concatenated responsibilities. Coupling is non-trivial (Ce=18, Ca=9), showing the component depends on and is depended on by many other modules. Together these elements (high total LOC, many classes with heavy internal concentration and nested types, and notable coupling) support classifying this package as a God Component."
