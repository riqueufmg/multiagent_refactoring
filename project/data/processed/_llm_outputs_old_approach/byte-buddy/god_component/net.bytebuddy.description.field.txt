    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "net.bytebuddy.description.field",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 17 classes and 1,418 LOC, with two larger classes (FieldDescription: 509 LOC; FieldList: 217 LOC) but an average ~83 LOC/class. The package also contains several small inner/auxiliary classes (tokens, latent, substituting, etc.) that decompose behavior. Coupling metrics (Ce=6, Ca=20) show moderate external dependencies and clients rather than an isolated monolithic hotspot. While individual classes are relatively large, the size appears domain-appropriate (field description/manipulation) and responsibilities are split into focused inner types, so the evidence does not support labeling the package a God Component."
