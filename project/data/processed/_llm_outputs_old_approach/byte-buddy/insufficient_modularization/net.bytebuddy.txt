The class lists numerous and diverse dependencies and contains multiple inner types, indicating it concentrates many responsibilities instead of smaller cohesive abstractions. Moderate cohesion (LCOM ~0.42) combined with size and responsibility breadth suggests inadequate decomposition."

It also contains several nested types (VersionLocator, Resolver, Resolved, Unresolved) and depends on varied concerns, implying multiple roles bundled into one class. Low/modest cohesion (LCOM ~0.19) supports that it could be split into clearer, smaller abstractions."

The structure appears to be a strategy holder with multiple small, focused nested classes (highly related responsibilities), and cohesion indicators (LCOM -1.0) do not indicate a bloated, multi-responsibility class; it is organized around a single concern (naming strategies)."

It provides specific nested key/storage types (StorageKey, LookupKey, SimpleKey, WithInlineExpunction) which indicate internal decomposition of concerns rather than one monolithic responsibility. Cohesion (LCOM 0.25) and the explicit cache-related subtypes suggest it is modular enough for its domain role."
