The package is small (2 classes, 298 LOC) so this class represents a large share of the package functionality. The combination of high method count, complexity and size indicates the abstraction is not adequately decomposed and likely suffers from insufficient modularization."

It shows no implementation coupling (fanout=0) and nopm=0 (no implemented public methods), so the size alone does not demonstrate a poor decomposition of responsibilities; it may be a deliberate API surface rather than a bloated implementation."
