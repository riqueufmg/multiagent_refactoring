Declares many fields (nof=16) and coexists with multiple nested/related types in the same compilation unit (InGenericShape, InDefinedShape, AbstractBase, ForLoadedField, Latent, TypeSubstituting, Token, SignatureToken), indicating multiple responsibilities concentrated in one file. The high LOC and the number of contained subtypes suggest the abstraction has not been decomposed into smaller cohesive classes."

The class holds several fields (nof=7) and provides list-like functionality together with many specialized implementations, which indicates multiple responsibilities and variants bundled together instead of being modularized into separate cohesive classes/files."
