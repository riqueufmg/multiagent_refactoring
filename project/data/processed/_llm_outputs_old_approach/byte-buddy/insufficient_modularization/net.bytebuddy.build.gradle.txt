The combination of size, method count and low cohesion indicates multiple responsibilities concentrated in one abstraction and suggests it should be decomposed into smaller, more focused classes."

These metrics indicate the class carries diverse responsibilities and an overly broad interface, signaling insufficient modularization."

Cohesion is low (lcom=0.1667) and it interacts with several external concepts (class file locators, plugins). This suggests the class bundles several responsibilities that could be split into more focused abstractions."

The low complexity and role as an aggregator make it less indicative of poor modularization at the class level."

Its responsibilities appear bounded and it relies on specific supporting types (IncrementalResolver, Plugin), suggesting a focused task abstraction rather than an overly bloated one."
