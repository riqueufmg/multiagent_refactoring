It handles multiple concerns around method-related attribute appending (methods, parameters, receiver types) suggesting a bloated interface and mixed responsibilities that should be split into more focused abstractions."

Its substantial independent logic within an enclosing AnnotationAppender signals insufficient decomposition — it reads like a separate responsibility that should be modularized further."
