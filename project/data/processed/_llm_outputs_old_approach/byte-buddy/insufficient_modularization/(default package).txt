Low cohesion metric (LCOM=0.833) indicates methods do not strongly relate to the same state, and DIT=0 with fanin/fanout=0 shows this class is a self-contained, potentially bloated unit rather than decomposed. Presence of a nearly identical class variant in the package (same class in wrapper and wrapper-legacy) reinforces that functionality may be duplicated rather than split into smaller cohesive abstractions."

      "justification": "Moderate size and complexity (LOC=93, WMC=12) with multiple fields (nof=6) and methods (nom=6) points to a class doing several things. The high LCOM (0.833) implies low cohesion among methods, and DIT=0 and zero coupling (fanin/fanout=0) indicate this logic is concentrated inside the class instead of delegated. The package contains a second, nearly identical implementation (wrapper vs wrapper-legacy), suggesting responsibilities have not been modularized or factored into smaller, reusable components."
