      "justification": "QuickRunner is small and low complexity (loc 23, wmc 2) with only a couple of methods (nom 2) and minimal state (nof 1). It has no incoming or outgoing package dependencies (fanin 0, fanout 0) and a simple interface, so it does not concentrate excessive responsibilities or present a bloated abstraction. Although LCOM is 1.0, the overall size and low complexity indicate the class is not a case of insufficient modularization."
