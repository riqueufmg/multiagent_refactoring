    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 5 classes and 390 LOC, which is modest in size for a package. Although HistoryManager is relatively large (200 LOC, 13 methods, WMC=24) and depends on many classes (it centralizes history-related logic and is used by HistoryActivity and DBHelper), the remaining classes are small (HistoryActivity 104 LOC, HistoryItem 29 LOC, HistoryItemAdapter 33 LOC, DBHelper 24 LOC) and responsibilities are not entirely concentrated in a single oversized component. The package size and class count do not indicate an excessively large component overall; therefore, there is insufficient evidence to label the package itself a God Component (HistoryManager may warrant local refactoring, but that does not make the whole package a God Component)."
