    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 16 classes with a total of 1,224 LOC and several classes concentrating a large portion of that size and complexity. Notably CalendarEventGenerator (235 LOC, WMC 41, 21 methods) and ContactInfoGenerator (221 LOC, WMC 46, 20 methods) together account for a large share of package LOC; Generator (194 LOC, WMC 18, 14 methods) and WifiGenerator (121 LOC, WMC 28) are also substantial. Multiple classes show high method counts and cyclomatic complexity, indicating concentrated responsibilities rather than evenly distributed functionality. These facts (total LOC, multiple very large/complex classes, many methods in a few classes) support detection of a God Component in this package."
