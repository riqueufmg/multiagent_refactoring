    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 15 classes and 864 LOC with a clear concentration of size and complexity in a few classes: DecodeServlet (loc 349, wmc 41, nom 8) accounts for ~40% of the package LOC, ChartServlet (loc 115, wmc 15) and DoSTracker (loc 85) add further large, distinct responsibilities. Several smaller classes (filters, request parameter parsing, utilities) coexist with heavy-weight servlets and tracking logic, indicating multiple responsibilities centralized in this package. High WMC values (e.g. 41 for DecodeServlet) and the mix of servlet logic, DoS tracking, filters and utilities support the judgment that this component is excessively large and acting as a God Component."
