    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and 228 LOC overall, which is not excessively large for a focused decoder package. Although DecodedBitStreamParser is the largest class (137 LOC, WMC 33, 10 methods) and could be considered relatively complex, the other classes are small (Decoder: 62 LOC, WMC 12; BitMatrixParser: 29 LOC, WMC 5). Afferent/efferent coupling is low (Ca=4, Ce=4) and responsibilities appear cohesive (all classes relate to MaxiCode decoding). Taken together, the size and class count do not indicate a package-level God Component despite one moderately large class."
