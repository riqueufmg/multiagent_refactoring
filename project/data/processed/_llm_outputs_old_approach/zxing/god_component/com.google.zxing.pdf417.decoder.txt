    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 11 classes but a total of 1,750 LOC with a strong concentration of size and complexity in a few classes: DecodedBitStreamParser (479 LOC, WMC 115), PDF417ScanningDecoder (455 LOC, WMC 108), DetectionResult (238 LOC, WMC 61) and DetectionResultRowIndicatorColumn (190 LOC, WMC 45). These four classes alone account for the majority of the package LOC and exhibit very high cyclomatic complexity (WMC) and many methods (e.g. PDF417ScanningDecoder nom=25, DecodedBitStreamParser nof=30), indicating large, complex responsibilities concentrated in a few components. This concentration of code and complexity within the package fits the contextual definition of a God Component (excessively large component in LOC and class-level complexity), so the smell is detected."
