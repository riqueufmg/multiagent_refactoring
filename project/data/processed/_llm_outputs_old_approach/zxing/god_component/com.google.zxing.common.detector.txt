    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes (num_classes=3) totaling 416 LOC, which is moderate and not excessively large for a component. The largest class, WhiteRectangleDetector, is 219 LOC and MonochromeRectangleDetector is 147 LOC while MathUtils is 50 LOC — these sizes, though non-trivial, do not by themselves indicate a single overwhelmingly large component dominating the package. Affected coupling metrics (Ce=9, Ca=9) show external dependencies but not extreme centralization. Based on the provided contextual data, the package does not meet the criteria for a God Component."
