    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.maxicode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 1 class and a total of 56 LOC, which is small both in number of classes and size. The single class (MaxiCodeReader) has modest complexity (WMC=9, loc=56) and low coupling indicators (fanin=0, fanout=0 in class metrics; Ce=3, Ca=3 at package level). Given the limited LOC, single class, and no evidence of excessive size or class count, there is insufficient indication of a God Component."
