    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package has 1,102 LOC across only 8 classes, with a strong concentration of code in a few classes: DecodedBitStreamParser (432 LOC, WMC 103) and BitMatrixParser (372 LOC, WMC 71) together account for ~73% of the package LOC (and adding Version's 115 LOC brings the three to ~83%). These two classes also show very high complexity (WMC 103 and 71), indicating they are doing large, complex work. The package size is therefore driven by a small number of very large/complex classes rather than being evenly distributed, meeting the contextual definition of a God Component."
