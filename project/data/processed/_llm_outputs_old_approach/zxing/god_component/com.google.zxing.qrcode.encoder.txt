    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package concentrates a large portion of functionality and code in a few very large, complex classes: total package LOC=1641 across 11 classes, with Encoder (LOC=434, WMC=90, NOM=25), MinimalEncoder (LOC=382, WMC=46, NOM=13) and MatrixUtil (LOC=226, WMC=55, NOM=20) together accounting for >60% of the package LOC. These classes show high complexity and many methods, and the package mixes encoding algorithms, matrix utilities, masking and data structures (QRCode, ByteMatrix, MaskUtil, BlockPair) indicating multiple responsibilities concentrated in one component. The concentration of size and complexity in a small number of classes supports the detection of a God Component."
