    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package totals 530 LOC across 5 classes, but the implementation and complexity are heavily concentrated in a few large, complex classes: GenericGFPoly (220 LOC, WMC 49), ReedSolomonDecoder (137 LOC, WMC 25), and GenericGF (118 LOC, WMC 20). A small number of classes hold most of the code and complexity, indicating centralized responsibilities. Additionally the package shows significant external coupling (Ce=8, Ca=8) and multiple cross-package dependencies, suggesting it is a central, tightly coupled component. These elements together support detecting a God Component (excessive size/complexity concentrated in this component)."
