    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 7 classes totaling 750 LOC, with the majority of LOC concentrated in three cohesive encoder-related classes (Encoder: 320 LOC, WMC 65; HighLevelEncoder: 180 LOC, WMC 33; State: 130 LOC, WMC 28). The class count is small and the LOC concentration reflects algorithmic complexity within an encoder domain rather than an excessively large or sprawling component. Coupling indicators (Ce=6, Ca=6) are moderate. Given the focused responsibility (Aztec encoding) and the modest number of classes, the data do not support labeling this package a God Component."
