    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 37 classes and 2,296 LOC, indicating substantial size and responsibility concentration. Several classes inside the package are individually large and complex (examples: VCardResultParser — loc 284, wmc 61; ResultParser — loc 184, wmc 43, nc 17; CalendarParsedResult — loc 173, wmc 28; VINResultParser — loc 153, wmc 54; AddressBookParsedResult — loc 137, wmc 22; ExpandedProductParsedResult — loc 113, wmc 20). The presence of many parser/result classes bundled in a single package handling diverse result types suggests the package aggregates multiple responsibilities rather than being focused/cohesive. These factors together (high overall LOC, high per-class LOC and complexity across many classes, and numerous distinct responsibilities) support detecting this package as a God Component."
