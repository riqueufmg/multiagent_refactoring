    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and 99 LOC overall (QRCodeMultiReader: 92 LOC, inner SAComparator: 7 LOC). Class-level complexity is moderate (QRCodeMultiReader wmc=16, nom=3) but the component is small in both number of classes and total lines of code. A God Component is characterized by an excessively large size (many classes or very high LOC); this package does not exhibit that, and its incoming/outgoing coupling (Ca=3, Ce=3) is modest, so there is insufficient evidence to label it a God Component."
