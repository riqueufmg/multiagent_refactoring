    "justification": "The package contains 14 classes and 965 LOC, with a strong concentration of size and responsibility in a few classes. ResultHandler alone is 361 LOC with 43 methods (nom), WMC 80 and many external dependencies (HistoryManager, PreferencesActivity, ResultParser, CaptureActivity, ScanFromWebPageManager, etc.), indicating high complexity and many responsibilities. In addition AddressBookResultHandler (126 LOC, WMC 26) and CalendarResultHandler (104 LOC, WMC 18) further increase package size. The distribution shows a small number of very large, complex classes centralizing behavior for many result types, consistent with a God Component smell."
