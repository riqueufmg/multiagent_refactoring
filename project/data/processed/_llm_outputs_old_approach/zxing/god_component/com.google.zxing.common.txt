    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package holds 2,224 LOC across 17 classes with several very large and highly complex classes concentrated in the same component: BitMatrix (442 LOC, 31 methods, WMC 89), BitArray (279 LOC, 27 methods, WMC 58), MinimalECIInput (243 LOC, 13 methods, WMC 48), StringUtils (198 LOC, WMC 36), HybridBinarizer (145 LOC, WMC 33), GlobalHistogramBinarizer (139 LOC, WMC 29). This concentration of size and high WMC indicates multiple responsibilities are implemented inside the package and within single classes. The package also shows substantial coupling (Ce = 29, Ca = 29) and many external dependencies, suggesting it acts as a central hub. Taken together — large total LOC, several oversized/complex classes, and high coupling — these elements justify classifying com.google.zxing.common as a God Component."
