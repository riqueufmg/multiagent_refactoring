    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.aztec.decoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package is overwhelmingly dominated by a single class: Decoder contains 319 of the package's 330 LOC (~97%), while the remaining two nested classes are tiny. Decoder shows high internal complexity (WMC=61), a large number of fields and methods (nof=10, nom=11), and encapsulates related nested types (Decoder.Table, Decoder.CorrectedBitsResult), indicating multiple responsibilities concentrated in one component. The package has only 3 classes overall but interacts with several external subsystems, suggesting the Decoder centralizes much functionality. These elements collectively indicate a God Component."
