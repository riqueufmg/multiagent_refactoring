    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package has 21 classes and 1,080 LOC with size and complexity concentrated in a few classes: GeneralAppIdDecoder is 350 LOC (≈32% of package LOC) with very high complexity (WMC=102) and 18 methods, and FieldParser is 244 LOC (≈23% of package LOC, WMC=18). Together those two classes account for ~55% of the package LOC, indicating centralized responsibilities. The remainder of the package contains many small classes, suggesting poor decomposition. Package-level coupling is low (Ca=3, Ce=3), meaning the functionality is largely self-contained rather than distributed, which reinforces that this component is carrying excessive size and responsibility and therefore behaves like a God Component."
