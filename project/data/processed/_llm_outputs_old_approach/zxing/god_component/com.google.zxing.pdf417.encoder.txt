    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.encoder",
    "detection": true,
    "justification": "The package contains 9 classes but a very high total of 1069 LOC, with two classes dominating the package: PDF417HighLevelEncoder (595 LOC, 18 public methods, WMC 94) and PDF417 (234 LOC, 14 public methods, WMC 31). These two classes account for ~78% of the package LOC, indicating concentrated responsibility and excessive size/complexity in a small number of components. High WMC and large method counts suggest heavy internal complexity and potential multiple responsibilities, supporting the detection of a God Component at the package level."
