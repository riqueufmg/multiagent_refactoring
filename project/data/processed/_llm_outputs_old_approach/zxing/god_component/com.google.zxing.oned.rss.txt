    "smell": "God Component",

    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes and 609 LOC, which is moderate in scale and not clearly 'excessively' large as a component. Although one class (RSS14Reader) is relatively large (362 LOC, WMC 73) and concentrates complexity, the rest of the package is small (e.g., AbstractRSSReader 104 LOC, RSSUtils 64 LOC, others << 100 LOC). Coupled instability/afferent-efferent coupling (Ca=4, Ce=4) is modest. Overall, the package size and class count do not justify labeling the entire package a God Component; the problem appears localized to a single large class rather than the component as a whole."
