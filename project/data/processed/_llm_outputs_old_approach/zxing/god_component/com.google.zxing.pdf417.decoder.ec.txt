    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.pdf417.decoder.ec",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 3 classes and a total of 396 LOC, which is modest in size. Individual class sizes are 192 LOC (ModulusPoly), 129 LOC (ErrorCorrection), and 75 LOC (ModulusGF); none are excessively large in the context provided. The class count (3) is low, and there is no indication of an overwhelmingly large component by LOC or number of classes. Therefore, the God Component smell is not detected."
