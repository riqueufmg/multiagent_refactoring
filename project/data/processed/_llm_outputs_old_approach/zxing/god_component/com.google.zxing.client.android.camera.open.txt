    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.camera.open",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package is small: num_classes = 3 and total LOC = 82. The largest class (OpenCameraInterface) is 51 LOC with WMC = 9; the other classes are 27 LOC (OpenCamera) and 4 LOC (CameraFacing). Coupling indicators are low (Ce = 1, Ca = 1) and there is no large aggregation of classes or extremely high LOC in a single component. Based on these metrics and the provided context, the package does not exhibit the excessive size characteristic of a God Component."
