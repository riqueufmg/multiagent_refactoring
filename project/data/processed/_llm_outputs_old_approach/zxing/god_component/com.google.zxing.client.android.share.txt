    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.share",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains 6 classes and 378 LOC — not an excessively large component in terms of number of classes or total LOC. Although ShareActivity is relatively large (184 LOC, WMC 36, 13 methods) and contributes ~50% of the package LOC, the remaining five classes are small (32–59 LOC each) with modest complexity. Package coupling (Ce=3, Ca=3) is low. Contextually, the size is driven by one activity rather than an overly large package with many classes, so the package itself does not qualify as a God Component."
