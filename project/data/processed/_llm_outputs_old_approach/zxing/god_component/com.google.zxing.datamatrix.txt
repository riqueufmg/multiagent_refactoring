    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.datamatrix",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 2 classes and a total of 233 LOC (DataMatrixReader: 95 LOC, DataMatrixWriter: 138 LOC). Neither the number of classes nor the overall LOC indicate an excessively large component. Class complexity (WMC 16 and 25) is moderate and the package coupling (Ce=5, Ca=5) does not by itself imply a single bloated component. The package responsibilities (reader and writer) are distinct and focused, so the available metrics do not support labeling this package as a God Component."
