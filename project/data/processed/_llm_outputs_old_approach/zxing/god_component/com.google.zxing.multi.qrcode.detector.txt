    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": "com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode.detector",
    "detection": false,
    "justification": "The package contains only 3 classes and a total of 206 LOC, which is not excessively large for a component. The largest class, MultiFinderPatternFinder, is 163 LOC with WMC 30 indicating some complexity, but the remainder (MultiDetector 34 LOC, ModuleSizeComparator 9 LOC) keeps the package compact. There is no large number of classes or an overwhelmingly large LOC concentration to justify labeling this package a God Component."
