    "justification": "The package has only 2 classes and 284 LOC, but one class (Detector) contains 259 LOC (~91% of package LOC), 13 fields, 9 methods and a high complexity (WMC=42). The second class (PDF417DetectorResult) is small (25 LOC). The extreme LOC concentration and high class complexity indicate the package's functionality is dominated by a single, excessively large class, supporting detection of a God Component."
