      "justification": "The class is large and complex (loc: 249, WMC: 32) which indicates substantial internal logic. It declares 11 methods but only 2 public methods (nom: 11, nopm: 2), suggesting many internal/private helpers and multiple responsibilities concentrated in the same class. The class has few fields (nof: 2) and no subclasses (nc: 0), implying functionality is implemented as behavior rather than cleanly separated abstractions. Its dependencies (WhiteRectangleDetector, BitMatrix, GridSampler, etc.) show it orchestrates several distinct detection/sampling concerns. Taken together, size, high complexity, many non-public methods and cross-cutting responsibilities justify that Detector is insufficiently modularized and would benefit from decomposition into smaller, more focused classes."
