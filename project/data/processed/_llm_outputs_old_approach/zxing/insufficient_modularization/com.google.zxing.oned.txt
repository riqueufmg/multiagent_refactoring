Handles a wide range of decoding logic and depends on many result/format concerns, suggesting concentrated responsibilities that would benefit from decomposition into smaller, cohesive classes (parsing, checksum, state machine)."

Its role is a shared abstraction; its size corresponds to shared behavior rather than a concentration of unrelated responsibilities, so it is reasonably modular for that purpose."
