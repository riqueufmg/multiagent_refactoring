Its cohesion is not ideal (lcom 0.333), suggesting it groups multiple responsibilities (detection, decoding, result handling) rather than a single, focused role. In a small package (only 2 classes) this concentration of size, complexity, and external coupling indicates the abstraction has not been sufficiently decomposed."

Its dependencies are targeted at encoding/encoder types, indicating a single responsibility (writing/encoding QR codes). Given its focused size, cohesion, and narrower coupling, it does not show signs of insufficient modularization."
