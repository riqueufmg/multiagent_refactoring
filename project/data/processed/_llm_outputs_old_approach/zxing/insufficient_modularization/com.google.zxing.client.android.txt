Low cohesion (LCOM≈0.10) and many diverse dependencies (camera, decode thread/handler, UI/Viewfinder, history, preferences, beep, ambient light, clipboard, result handlers, etc.), indicating it concentrates multiple responsibilities (UI, camera control, decoding orchestration, result handling, history, settings) that could be split into smaller, more focused classes."

Its single responsibility (intent definitions) argues against insufficient modularization."
