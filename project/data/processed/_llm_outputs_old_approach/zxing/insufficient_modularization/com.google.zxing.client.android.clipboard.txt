      "justification": "Class is small (31 LOC) with a modest number of methods (5) and moderate complexity (WMC=6). Cohesion is reasonable (LCOM=0.4), no inheritance (DIT=0), and coupling is low at class level (fanin=0, fanout=0) despite two external references. These indicators point to a focused, lightweight abstraction rather than a bloated, multifunctional class, so insufficient modularization is not detected."
