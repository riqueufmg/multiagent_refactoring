# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: God Component

Definition:
God Component arise when a component is **excessively** large either in terms of Lines Of Code or the number of classes.

# Constraints

- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section, without any comments or explanations.
- The **justification** field must summarize the key elements that support the detection result.
- Only perform the analysis if you deem the information in the **#Input** section sufficient. Otherwise, follow the guidelines in the **#Unsuccessful Output** section.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Do not rely on fixed metric thresholds; use contextual judgment based on the provided data.

# Input

The following metrics and dependencies are available at package and class levels:

```json
{"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.eliminatedallocation", "metrics": {"num_classes": 2, "loc": 101, "Ce": 2, "Ca": 1}, "classes": [{"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.eliminatedallocation", "class": "EliminatedAllocationRowBuilder", "file": "data/repositories/jitwatch/ui/src/main/java/org/adoptopenjdk/jitwatch/ui/report/eliminatedallocation/EliminatedAllocationRowBuilder.java", "metrics": {"nof": 0, "nopf": 0, "nom": 8, "nopm": 7, "loc": 69, "wmc": 8, "nc": 0, "dit": 0, "lcom": -1.0, "fanin": 0, "fanout": 0}, "dependencies": []}, {"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.report.eliminatedallocation", "class": "EliminatedAllocationRowBean", "file": "data/repositories/jitwatch/ui/src/main/java/org/adoptopenjdk/jitwatch/ui/report/eliminatedallocation/EliminatedAllocationRowBean.java", "metrics": {"nof": 0, "nopf": 0, "nom": 6, "nopm": 6, "loc": 32, "wmc": 8, "nc": 0, "dit": 2, "lcom": -1.0, "fanin": 0, "fanout": 0}, "dependencies": ["org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.Report", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report.ReportType", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.Compilation"]}], "dependencies": ["org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.report", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model"]}
```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": [package name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```
