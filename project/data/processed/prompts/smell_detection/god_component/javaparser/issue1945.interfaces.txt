# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: God Component

Definition:
God Component arise when a component is **excessively** large either in terms of Lines Of Code or the number of classes.

# Constraints

- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section, without any comments or explanations.
- The **justification** field must summarize the key elements that support the detection result.
- Only perform the analysis if you deem the information in the **#Input** section sufficient. Otherwise, follow the guidelines in the **#Unsuccessful Output** section.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Do not rely on fixed metric thresholds; use contextual judgment based on the provided data.

# Input

The following metrics and dependencies are available at package and class levels:

```json
{"package": "issue1945.interfaces", "metrics": {"num_classes": 3, "loc": 20, "Ce": 0, "Ca": 2}, "classes": [{"package": "issue1945.interfaces", "class": "HairType", "file": "data/repositories/javaparser/javaparser-symbol-solver-testing/target/test-classes/issue1945/issue1945/interfaces/HairType.java", "metrics": {"nof": 0, "nopf": 0, "nom": 1, "nopm": 0, "loc": 3, "wmc": 1, "nc": 0, "dit": 0, "lcom": -1.0, "fanin": 0, "fanout": 0}, "dependencies": []}, {"package": "issue1945.interfaces", "class": "HairyAnimal", "file": "data/repositories/javaparser/javaparser-symbol-solver-testing/target/test-classes/issue1945/issue1945/interfaces/HairyAnimal.java", "metrics": {"nof": 0, "nopf": 0, "nom": 1, "nopm": 0, "loc": 3, "wmc": 1, "nc": 0, "dit": 0, "lcom": -1.0, "fanin": 0, "fanout": 0}, "dependencies": ["issue1945.interfaces.HairType"]}, {"package": "issue1945.interfaces", "class": "HairTypeRenderer", "file": "data/repositories/javaparser/javaparser-symbol-solver-testing/target/test-classes/issue1945/issue1945/interfaces/HairTypeRenderer.java", "metrics": {"nof": 0, "nopf": 0, "nom": 2, "nopm": 1, "loc": 14, "wmc": 2, "nc": 0, "dit": 0, "lcom": -1.0, "fanin": 0, "fanout": 0}, "dependencies": ["issue1945.interfaces.HairyAnimal", "issue1945.interfaces.HairType"]}], "dependencies": []}
```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": [package name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```
