# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Unstable Dependency.

Definition:
Unstable Dependency arises when a component depends on other less stable components. Stable Dependencies Principle states that the dependencies between packages should be in the direction of the stability of packages. Hence, a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself. An unstable dependency architecture smell occurs when this principle is not followed.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis at the **package level** and evaluate each package individually.
- When assessing each package, consider outgoing dependencies and incoming dependencies
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Output** are mandatory.

# Input

The following metrics and dependencies, including incoming and outgoing dependencies, are available for each package:

```json
{"analyzed_package": {"package": "com.google.zxing.aztec.decoder", "metrics": {"num_classes": 3, "loc": 330, "Ce": 5, "Ca": 1}, "dependencies": ["com.google.zxing.common", "com.google.zxing", "com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder", "com.google.zxing.aztec", "com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon"]}, "outgoing_dependencies": [{"package": "com.google.zxing.common", "metrics": {"num_classes": 17, "loc": 2224, "Ce": 1, "Ca": 29}, "dependencies": ["com.google.zxing"]}, {"package": "com.google.zxing", "metrics": {"num_classes": 24, "loc": 1265, "Ce": 2, "Ca": 36}, "dependencies": ["com.google.zxing.common", "com.google.zxing.common.detector"]}, {"package": "com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder", "metrics": {"num_classes": 7, "loc": 750, "Ce": 5, "Ca": 3}, "dependencies": ["com.google.zxing.common", "com.google.zxing.aztec.decoder", "com.google.zxing", "com.google.zxing.aztec", "com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon"]}, {"package": "com.google.zxing.aztec", "metrics": {"num_classes": 3, "loc": 161, "Ce": 4, "Ca": 3}, "dependencies": ["com.google.zxing.common", "com.google.zxing", "com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder", "com.google.zxing.aztec.detector"]}, {"package": "com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon", "metrics": {"num_classes": 5, "loc": 530, "Ce": 0, "Ca": 8}, "dependencies": []}], "incoming_dependencies": [{"package": "com.google.zxing.aztec.encoder", "metrics": {"num_classes": 7, "loc": 750, "Ce": 5, "Ca": 3}, "dependencies": ["com.google.zxing.common", "com.google.zxing.aztec.decoder", "com.google.zxing", "com.google.zxing.aztec", "com.google.zxing.common.reedsolomon"]}]}
```

# Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
"package": "[package_name]",
"detection": false,
"justification": "[Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]"
}
```
