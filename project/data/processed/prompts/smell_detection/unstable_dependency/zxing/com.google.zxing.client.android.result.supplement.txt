# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Unstable Dependency.

Definition:
Unstable Dependency arises when a component depends on other less stable components. Stable Dependencies Principle states that the dependencies between packages should be in the direction of the stability of packages. Hence, a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself. An unstable dependency architecture smell occurs when this principle is not followed.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis at the **package level** and evaluate each package individually.
- When assessing each package, consider outgoing dependencies and incoming dependencies
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Output** are mandatory.

# Input

The following metrics and dependencies, including incoming and outgoing dependencies, are available for each package:

```json
{"analyzed_package": {"package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.supplement", "metrics": {"num_classes": 5, "loc": 266, "Ce": 3, "Ca": 1}, "dependencies": ["com.google.zxing.client.android", "com.google.zxing.client.result", "com.google.zxing.client.android.history"]}, "outgoing_dependencies": [{"package": "com.google.zxing.client.android", "metrics": {"num_classes": 33, "loc": 2328, "Ce": 6, "Ca": 7}, "dependencies": ["com.google.zxing.client.android.result", "com.google.zxing.client.android.camera", "com.google.zxing.client.android.history", "com.google.zxing", "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.supplement", "com.google.zxing.client.android.clipboard"]}, {"package": "com.google.zxing.client.result", "metrics": {"num_classes": 37, "loc": 2296, "Ce": 2, "Ca": 6}, "dependencies": ["com.google.zxing", "com.google.zxing.oned"]}, {"package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.history", "metrics": {"num_classes": 5, "loc": 390, "Ce": 3, "Ca": 2}, "dependencies": ["com.google.zxing.client.android.result", "com.google.zxing.client.android", "com.google.zxing"]}], "incoming_dependencies": [{"package": "com.google.zxing.client.android", "metrics": {"num_classes": 33, "loc": 2328, "Ce": 6, "Ca": 7}, "dependencies": ["com.google.zxing.client.android.result", "com.google.zxing.client.android.camera", "com.google.zxing.client.android.history", "com.google.zxing", "com.google.zxing.client.android.result.supplement", "com.google.zxing.client.android.clipboard"]}]}
```

# Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
"package": "[package_name]",
"detection": false,
"justification": "[Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]"
}
```
