# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Unstable Dependency.

Definition:
Unstable Dependency arises when a component depends on other less stable components. Stable Dependencies Principle states that the dependencies between packages should be in the direction of the stability of packages. Hence, a package should only depend on packages that are more stable than itself. An unstable dependency architecture smell occurs when this principle is not followed.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis at the **package level** and evaluate each package individually.
- When assessing each package, consider outgoing dependencies and incoming dependencies
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Output** are mandatory.

# Input

The following metrics and dependencies, including incoming and outgoing dependencies, are available for each package:

```json
{"analyzed_package": {"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.invokecount", "metrics": {"num_classes": 3, "loc": 83, "Ce": 2, "Ca": 1}, "dependencies": ["org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode"]}, "outgoing_dependencies": [{"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util", "metrics": {"num_classes": 17, "loc": 1880, "Ce": 5, "Ca": 39}, "dependencies": ["org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.assembly", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode"]}, {"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode", "metrics": {"num_classes": 22, "loc": 1547, "Ce": 3, "Ca": 22}, "dependencies": ["org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.compilation", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util"]}], "incoming_dependencies": [{"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan", "metrics": {"num_classes": 2, "loc": 307, "Ce": 11, "Ca": 0}, "dependencies": ["org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.nextinstruction", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.methodsizehisto", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencesearch", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.freqinlinesize", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.sequencecount", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.invokecount", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.allocationcount", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.loader", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.methodlength", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.model.bytecode", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jarscan.instructioncount"]}]}
```

# Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
"package": "[package_name]",
"detection": false,
"justification": "[Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]"
}
```
