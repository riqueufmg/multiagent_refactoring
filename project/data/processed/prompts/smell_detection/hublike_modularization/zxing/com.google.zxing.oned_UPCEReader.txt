# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring. Your task is to detect the smell: Hub-like Modularization.

Definition:
Hub-like Modularization  arises when an abstraction has dependencies (both incoming and outgoing) with a large number of other abstractions.

# Constraints
- I give as input software metrics and dependencies.
- The analysis must consider the class in isolation. Do not assume the existence of other classes, packages, or system-level context beyond the provided data.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.

# Input

```json
{
  "analyzed_package": {
    "package": "com.google.zxing.oned",
    "class": "UPCEReader",
    "dependencies": [
      "com.google.zxing.common.BitArray",
      "com.google.zxing.NotFoundException",
      "com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat"
    ]
  },
  "outgoing_dependencies": [
    {
      "package": "com.google.zxing.common",
      "class": "BitArray",
      "dependencies": []
    },
    {
      "package": "com.google.zxing",
      "class": "NotFoundException",

    },

        "com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat"
      ]
    }

# Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "class": [package name].[class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```
