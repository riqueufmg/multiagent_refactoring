# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring. Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class exists that has not been completely decomposed, and a further decomposition could reduce its size, implementation complexity, or both.

# Constraints
- I give as input software metrics and dependencies.
- The analysis must consider the class in isolation. Do not assume the existence of other classes, packages, or system-level context beyond the provided data.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.

# Input

```json
{"package": "com.google.zxing.client.android.encode", "class": "QRCodeEncoder", "file": "data/repositories/zxing/android/src/com/google/zxing/client/android/encode/QRCodeEncoder.java", "metrics": {"nof": 9, "nopf": 0, "nom": 15, "nopm": 0, "loc": 266, "wmc": 57, "nc": 0, "dit": 0, "lcom": 0.0, "fanin": 0, "fanout": 0}, "dependencies": ["com.google.zxing.EncodeHintType", "com.google.zxing.client.android.Contents", "com.google.zxing.client.result.ParsedResult", "com.google.zxing.client.android.Intents", "com.google.zxing.BarcodeFormat", "com.google.zxing.Result", "com.google.zxing.client.result.ResultParser", "com.google.zxing.client.result.AddressBookParsedResult", "com.google.zxing.client.android.encode.ContactEncoder", "com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix"]}
```

# Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "class": [package name].[class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```
