# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring. Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class exists that has not been completely decomposed, and a further decomposition could reduce its size, implementation complexity, or both.

# Constraints
- I give as input software metrics and dependencies.
- The analysis must consider the class in isolation. Do not assume the existence of other classes, packages, or system-level context beyond the provided data.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.

# Input

```json
{"package": "com.google.zxing.multi.qrcode.detector", "class": "MultiFinderPatternFinder", "file": "data/repositories/zxing/core/src/main/java/com/google/zxing/multi/qrcode/detector/MultiFinderPatternFinder.java", "metrics": {"nof": 7, "nopf": 0, "nom": 3, "nopm": 2, "loc": 163, "wmc": 30, "nc": 0, "dit": 0, "lcom": 0.6666666666666666, "fanin": 0, "fanout": 0}, "dependencies": ["com.google.zxing.ResultPoint", "com.google.zxing.DecodeHintType", "com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.FinderPattern", "com.google.zxing.ResultPointCallback", "com.google.zxing.qrcode.detector.FinderPatternInfo", "com.google.zxing.common.BitMatrix", "com.google.zxing.NotFoundException"]}
```

# Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "class": [package name].[class name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```
