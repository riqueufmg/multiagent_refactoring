# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: God Component

Definition: when a component is **excessively** large either in terms of Lines Of Code or the number of classes.

# Constraints

- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section, without any comments or explanations.
- The **justification** field must summarize the key elements that support the detection result.
- Only perform the analysis if you deem the information in the **#Input** section sufficient. Otherwise, follow the guidelines in the **#Unsuccessful Output** section.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Do not rely on fixed metric thresholds; use contextual judgment based on the provided data.

# Input

The following metrics and dependencies are available at package and class levels:

```json
{"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.source", "metrics": {"num_classes": 1, "loc": 28, "Ce": 3, "Ca": 1}, "classes": [{"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.source", "class": "ViewerSource", "file": "data/repositories/jitwatch/ui/src/main/java/org/adoptopenjdk/jitwatch/ui/triview/source/ViewerSource.java", "metrics": {"nof": 0, "nopf": 0, "nom": 2, "nopm": 2, "loc": 28, "wmc": 5, "nc": 0, "dit": 1, "lcom": -1.0, "fanin": 0, "fanout": 0}, "dependencies": ["org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.ILineListener", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview.InstructionLabel", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util.StringUtil", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main.IStageAccessProxy"]}], "dependencies": ["org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.main", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.ui.triview", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.util"]}
```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": [package name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect God Component with the available data."
}
```
