# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: God Component

Definition: when a component is **excessively** large either in terms of Lines Of Code or the number of classes.

# Constraints

- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section, without any comments or explanations.
- The **justification** field must summarize the key elements that support the detection result.
- Only perform the analysis if you deem the information in the **#Input** section sufficient. Otherwise, follow the guidelines in the **#Unsuccessful Output** section.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Do not rely on fixed metric thresholds; use contextual judgment based on the provided data.

# Input

The following metrics and dependencies are available at package and class levels:

```json
{"package": "com.google.zxing.integration.android", "metrics": {"num_classes": 2, "loc": 380, "Ce": 0, "Ca": 0}, "classes": [{"package": "com.google.zxing.integration.android", "class": "IntentIntegrator", "file": "data/repositories/zxing/android-integration/src/main/java/com/google/zxing/integration/android/IntentIntegrator.java", "metrics": {"nof": 24, "nopf": 12, "nom": 34, "nopm": 27, "loc": 325, "wmc": 61, "nc": 0, "dit": 0, "lcom": 0.0588235294117647, "fanin": 0, "fanout": 0}, "dependencies": ["com.google.zxing.integration.android.IntentResult"]}, {"package": "com.google.zxing.integration.android", "class": "IntentResult", "file": "data/repositories/zxing/android-integration/src/main/java/com/google/zxing/integration/android/IntentResult.java", "metrics": {"nof": 5, "nopf": 0, "nom": 8, "nopm": 6, "loc": 55, "wmc": 8, "nc": 0, "dit": 0, "lcom": 0.25, "fanin": 0, "fanout": 0}, "dependencies": ["com.google.zxing.integration.android.IntentIntegrator"]}], "dependencies": []}
```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
    "smell": "God Component",
    "package": [package name],
    "detection": [true/false],
    "justification": [Reasons for the detection result, citing the elements that justify the decision]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect God Component with the available data."
}
```
