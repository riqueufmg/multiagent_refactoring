# Task

You are a software engineering expert in software refactoring.

Your task is to detect the smell: Insufficient Modularization.

Definition:
Insufficient Modularization arises when a class represents an abstraction that has not been
adequately decomposed, resulting in excessive size, complexity, or a bloated interface.
Such classes are difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, and often concentrate
responsibilities that could be separated into smaller, more cohesive abstractions.

# Constraints

- Perform the analysis at the **class level**, even though the input is provided at the package level.
- Use the package data only as contextual information to support class-level judgments.
- Do not rely on fixed metric thresholds; use contextual judgment based on the provided data.
- Give the answer exactly in the structure defined in the **#Successful Output** section.
- Do not include comments, explanations, or text outside the defined output format.
- All fields in the **#Successful Output** are mandatory.
- Only perform the analysis if the provided data are sufficient; otherwise, follow the **#Unsuccessful Output** format.

# Input

The following metrics and dependencies are available at package and class levels:

```json
{"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang", "metrics": {"num_classes": 1, "loc": 123, "Ce": 4, "Ca": 3}, "classes": [{"package": "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.jvmlang", "class": "LanguageManager", "file": "data/repositories/jitwatch/core/src/main/java/org/adoptopenjdk/jitwatch/jvmlang/LanguageManager.java", "metrics": {"nof": 2, "nopf": 0, "nom": 8, "nopm": 8, "loc": 123, "wmc": 43, "nc": 0, "dit": 0, "lcom": 0.5, "fanin": 0, "fanout": 0}, "dependencies": ["org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.RuntimeScala", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.IRuntime", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.CompilerScala", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.RuntimeKotlin", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.RuntimeJavaScript", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.CompilerJavaScript", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.CompilerGroovy", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.CompilerKotlin", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.RuntimeGroovy", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.RuntimeJRuby", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core.JITWatchConfig", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.CompilerJava", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger.ILogListener", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.ICompiler", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler.CompilerJRuby", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime.RuntimeJava"]}], "dependencies": ["org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.logger", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.core", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.compiler", "org.adoptopenjdk.jitwatch.process.runtime"]}
```

# Successful Output

Provide the output in this structure:

```json
{
  "smell": "Insufficient Modularization",
  "package": "[package name]",
  "detections": [
    {
      "class": "[class name]",
      "detection": true,
      "justification": "[Key elements that justify why this class suffers from insufficient modularization]"
    },
    {
      "class": "[class name]",
      "detection": false,
      "justification": "[Key elements that justify why this class does not suffer from insufficient modularization]"
    }
  ]
}
```

# Unsucessfull Output

If the available data are insufficient to detect this smell, return:

```json
{
    "message": "It is impossible to detect Insufficient Modularization with the available data."
}
```
